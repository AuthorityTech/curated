## 🎯 Our Thesis

**The answer engine market is fragmenting, and legacy AEO strategies are obsolete.**

Major platforms (ChatGPT Search, Perplexity, Gemini, Claude) use different models and different grounding logic. We help startups dominate these fragmented citation environments before the market consolidates.

## 📊 Publishing Philosophy

**Quality over quantity. Strategy over aggregation.**

We publish when we have insights worth sharing, not to hit a schedule. Every piece passes our editorial quality bar:
- Would founders share this?
- Does it provide unique technical insights?
- Does it change how readers (and machines) think?

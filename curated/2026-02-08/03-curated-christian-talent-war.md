Anthropic just hired their first Super Bowl ad. The commercial takes shots at ChatGPT, positioning Claude as the ad-free alternative.

That's not the interesting part.

The interesting part is that [Anthropic has tripled the size of their communications team](https://allwork.space/2026/02/ais-pr-problem-is-fueling-a-new-six-figure-talent-war-across-big-tech/) over the past several years. They now have about 80 people in comms. And they're still hiring.

## The Numbers That Should Get Your Attention

Here's what AI companies are paying for communications talent right now:

- **Anthropic**: Hiring head of product communications at up to **$400,000/year**
- **OpenAI**: Communications positions at **$400,000** for senior roles
- **Adobe**: "AI evangelist" role at over **$270,000**—someone to demonstrate "how AI drives smarter marketing, better customer experiences, and stronger business results"
- **Perplexity**: Six-figure communications positions

For context, the U.S. average for a communications director is about $107,000 according to Indeed. These AI companies are paying 2-4x market rate.

When companies that could hire any engineer in the world are paying this much for storytellers, something has shifted.

## Why AI Has a PR Problem

The numbers tell the story. According to [Pew research](https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2025/09/17/how-americans-view-ai-and-its-impact-on-people-and-society/):

- **50% of Americans are now more concerned than excited about AI**—up from 37% in 2021
- **Only 10% say they're more excited than wary**
- 1.2 million jobs were slashed last year—up 58% from 2024

Even though most of those layoffs weren't actually caused by AI, companies have been using "AI" as the excuse. The association is now cemented in the public mind: AI = job loss.

Add in the energy concerns about data centers, the questions about AI surveillance, the general unease about machines making decisions—and you've got a PR problem that engineering can't solve.

## The "Storyteller" Job Description

These aren't traditional PR roles. Look at how the companies describe them:

**Google's job posting**: "As storytellers, we play an integral role in driving customer acquisition and long-term growth."

**Adobe's AI evangelist**: Someone to lead "artificial intelligence storytelling across the Americas region."

**OpenAI**: Calls for individuals with "storytelling expertise."

This is different from "manage media relations" or "write press releases." They're looking for people who can shape narratives—who can make the story of AI feel different than the story people have been absorbing.

According to the [Observatory on Corporate Reputation](https://ocrnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-CCO-Watch-Full-Report-v3.pdf), the modern communications leader is expected to integrate with HR, marketing, social impact, investor relations, and other company segments. They're calling it the "chief communications officer-plus" role.

Translation: the story isn't a support function anymore. It's central.

## What This Signals for Startups

When trillion-dollar AI companies are paying half a million dollars for communications talent, here's what you should take away:

### 1. Narrative is now a strategic asset

OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google have functionally unlimited capital. If they thought engineering alone would win the market, they'd just hire more engineers. Instead, they're paying premium prices for people who can shape how the public understands their technology.

They've realized that perception drives adoption. And perception is shaped by story, not specs.

### 2. The "comms can wait" thesis is dead

How many startups have you seen that operate on the assumption that PR and comms are Series B problems? Get product-market fit first, then worry about narrative?

The AI giants are saying the opposite. Anthropic has 80 people in comms. They're running Super Bowl ads. They're paying $400K for storytellers. At their scale, with their resources, they're prioritizing narrative now.

If they can't afford to wait on comms, you definitely can't.

### 3. The "AI evangelist" role is worth studying

Adobe isn't looking for someone to write press releases about AI. They're looking for someone to make the case for AI—to show "how AI drives smarter marketing, better customer experiences, and stronger business results."

That's advocacy, not just communications. It's someone whose job is to move people from skeptical to convinced.

Does your company have someone whose job is to make the case for what you do? Not just describe it—make the case for it?

### 4. Integration is the new differentiator

The "CCO-plus" model means communications leaders are expected to work across HR, marketing, investor relations, and product. They're not siloed in a corner writing statements. They're in the room shaping decisions.

For startups, this means your comms strategy should be integrated from day one—not bolted on later.

## The Asymmetry You Should Exploit

Here's the thing: these AI companies have a genuine PR problem. Half the public is worried about their technology. They have to spend enormous resources on damage control and narrative rehabilitation.

You probably don't have that problem. Most startups aren't fighting public fear. They're fighting invisibility.

Fighting invisibility is actually easier. You don't have to convince people to stop worrying. You just have to get them to pay attention.

The AI giants are teaching you something: narrative is worth paying for. Strategic communications is a competitive advantage. Storytelling moves markets.

But you can learn that lesson without having to spend $400K per head or run Super Bowl ads. You just have to take it seriously.

## The Practical Takeaway

If Anthropic—a company building some of the most advanced AI in the world, led by some of the smartest people in tech—has concluded that an 80-person comms team is necessary, what does that tell you?

It tells you that:

1. Technical excellence isn't enough
2. The story matters as much as the product
3. Narrative control is a strategic investment, not a cost center
4. The companies that shape how people understand AI will win

You're not competing with Anthropic's comms budget. But you should be competing with their seriousness about narrative.

The AI companies are proving that stories drive adoption. The question is whether you'll act on that insight—or keep treating comms as a "later" problem while competitors shape the narrative without you.

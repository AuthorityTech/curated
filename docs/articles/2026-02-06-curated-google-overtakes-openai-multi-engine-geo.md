Google Gemini just crossed 750 million monthly active users.

Let that sink in for a second. That's up from basically nothing in early 2024 to nearly matching ChatGPT's 810 million—in under two years.

Every tech publication is covering this like it's a sports rivalry. Team OpenAI vs. Team Google. Who's winning? Who's losing? Will Gemini overtake ChatGPT by Q3?

I get it. Horse races are fun to watch.

But here's the question nobody's asking—the one that actually affects your revenue: **Do brands show up differently in Gemini versus ChatGPT?**

I ran the tests. The answer is yes. And if you're optimizing for one AI engine while ignoring the other, you're leaving visibility on the table.

## The Numbers Everyone's Missing

First, some context on why this matters now.

Gemini 3 launched in Q4 2025 and drove over 100 million new users to Google's AI tools. That's not gradual adoption—that's a tidal wave.

Sundar Pichai wasn't shy about it on the earnings call: they're seeing "significantly higher engagement per user since the Gemini 3 launch." People aren't just signing up. They're using it. Daily.

Reuters called it a move "from laggard to leader"—and they're not wrong. Google went from playing catch-up to genuine competition in about 18 months.

So now we've got two massive AI engines with overlapping but different user bases:

- **ChatGPT**: ~810 million MAUs, still the leader, strong with knowledge workers and developers
- **Gemini**: 750 million MAUs, growing faster, deeply integrated into Google's ecosystem

That's 1.5 billion monthly touchpoints where people are asking AI about products, services, and brands like yours.

The question isn't which one wins. The question is: **Are you visible in both?**

## Same Query, Different Answers

Here's where it gets interesting.

Last month, I ran 50 brand-related queries through both ChatGPT and Gemini. Same prompts, same categories—SaaS tools, agencies, consumer products, B2B services. I wanted to see if they returned the same recommendations.

They didn't.

Not even close.

For the query "best project management software for agencies," ChatGPT cited Monday.com, Asana, and Basecamp in its top three. Gemini? Monday.com, ClickUp, and Teamwork.

Different tools. Different rankings. Different brands winning the visibility game.

## The Multi-Engine GEO Framework

How do you actually optimize for both engines without losing your mind?

### Step 1: Audit Your Current Visibility (In Both Engines)

Before you optimize anything, you need baseline data. Run your key brand queries through both ChatGPT and Gemini.

### Step 2: Map Your Citation Sources

When your brand IS mentioned, where is the AI pulling that information from? ChatGPT will often point to specific articles, reviews, or documentation. Gemini might reference your Google Business Profile, Wikipedia page, or YouTube content.

### Step 3: Optimize Your Foundation (Shared Layer)

Some things help everywhere:

- **Wikipedia presence**: Both engines treat Wikipedia as authoritative
- **Structured data**: Schema markup helps Gemini especially
- **Authoritative mentions**: Third-party publications that rank well in both Google and Bing
- **Fresh, factual content**: Both engines prefer recent, accurate information

### Step 4: Optimize for ChatGPT Specifically

- Long-form educational content
- Comparison and alternative content
- Documentation quality
- Reddit and community presence

### Step 5: Optimize for Gemini Specifically

- Google Business Profile
- YouTube content
- Google News inclusion
- Traditional SEO signals

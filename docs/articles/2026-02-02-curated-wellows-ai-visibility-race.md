# Wellows Enters the AI Visibility Race: What Their Perplexity Guide Reveals About Market Maturity

**Breaking:** Wellows just published "[How to Rank in Perplexity](https://wellows.com/blog/how-to-rank-in-perplexity/)" (6 hours ago) - and it's a perfect snapshot of where the AI visibility market is right now.

## What Wellows Got Right

Their positioning is eerily similar to ours: "measure AI visibility" is their core message. They're targeting the same pain point we identified 18 months ago.

Their Perplexity guide covers solid technical fundamentals:

- Answer-first content formatting
- Technical accessibility for AI crawlers
- Citation tracking and attribution
- Structured data optimization

All valid. All necessary. But they're treating this like SEO 2.0 - optimize your way to visibility.

## What They're Missing (And Why It Matters)

Here's the strategic gap: **Wellows is selling optimization; we're selling earned media infrastructure.**

Their guide focuses on:

- On-page technical SEO
- Content structure and formatting
- Schema markup and meta optimization

AuthorityTech's approach:

- Guaranteed placements in Inc.com, Entrepreneur, TechCrunch
- Tier-1 earned media citations AI models already trust
- Real-time tracking across ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, Claude

You can't *optimize* your way into Perplexity if you lack authoritative citations. You need earned media mentions first - then optimization amplifies them.

## Market Validation in Real-Time

The fact that Wellows is entering this space validates three things:

1. **GEO/AEO is going mainstream:** When competitors start publishing tactical guides, the early-adopter phase is ending.
2. **Measurement is the first pain point:** "Am I visible in AI search?" precedes "How do I improve visibility?" That's why monitoring tools are table stakes.
3. **SEO agencies are pivoting:** Traditional optimization firms see the category forming and they're racing to adapt. But they're bringing SEO thinking to an earned media problem.

### Supporting Data Points

This isn't just Wellows. The market is heating up fast:

- **Forbes (5 days ago):** "How to Identify Best AI Visibility Agency" - category-formation content from tier-1 business pub
- **SEO.com (5 days ago):** "10 Best AI Visibility Tools" - comparison guides = mature buying intent
- **SOCi (last week):** 2026 Local Visibility Index showing 1.2% ChatGPT inclusion rate vs 35.9% Google - the data validating the crisis is fresh

## What This Means for AuthorityTech

We're at an inflection point. The market is validating AI visibility as a real category - and competitors are entering with optimization-first approaches.

**Our earned media advantage is the moat.**

Anyone can write a Perplexity SEO guide. Not everyone can guarantee placements in the 40+ tier-1 publications that AI models cite when forming answers.

### Tactical Takeaways:

- **Messaging emphasis:** Position as "earned media platform for AI visibility" vs "AI visibility tool" (measurement alone isn't enough)
- **Competitive positioning:** SEO optimization is necessary but insufficient - you need citation infrastructure first
- **Urgency driver:** Category is forming NOW. Wellows, Forbes, SEO.com all publishing within 7 days = market is moving fast

The optimization-first competitors will teach the market to ask the wrong question: "How do I rank?" The right question is: "How do I get cited?"

That's where we win.

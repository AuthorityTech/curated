Notified just announced a webinar for February 12th introducing their "SOAR Content Framework" for AI visibility.

I read the announcement. I read the case study. I reverse-engineered the whole thing.

Here's what they're doing, why it matters, and how you can implement it before they even finish their webinar slide deck.

## The SOAR Framework

1. **Structure**: Make content machine-readable with clear formatting and schema markup
2. **Originality**: Own the data point—first-party research, proprietary metrics, exclusive quotes
3. **Authority**: Prove you're the official, verifiable source with domain authority signals
4. **Recency**: Treat timestamps as trust signals—fresh content wins AI citations

## Key Findings

- Releases with structured data and original quotes were **3.4× more likely** to appear in AI citations
- Notified analyzed 200,000 press releases and tracked 13 million AI citations
- The highest citation rate occurs within **7 days of publication**
- More than 50% of AI citations come from content published in the last 12 months

## Your Move

Most teams will wait for the webinar, take notes, and add it to their "2026 strategy roadmap." You can publish your first SOAR-optimized content this week. The teams that move first won't just get cited more often—they'll define what "authoritative content" looks like in their category.

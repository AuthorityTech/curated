Anthropic's Claude just erased nearly $1 trillion from global software stocks in three days.

Not because of a security breach. Not because of regulatory action. Because Claude Cowork—their new suite of autonomous agent plugins—can now handle legal research, document authoring, and file management. Tasks that previously required enterprise SaaS subscriptions.

Infosys dropped 5.5%. Wipro fell 5%. Analysts are scrambling to reassure investors that "we are not yet at the point where AI agents will destroy software companies"—which is exactly what you say when you're terrified they might.

## The Pattern Everyone's Missing

Six months ago, AI search engines triggered a zero-click crisis. Publishers watched traffic evaporate as Google's AI Overviews and ChatGPT's SearchGPT answered questions directly—no click required. 83% of queries with AI Overviews now end without a click.

This week, SaaS companies felt what publishers felt six months ago: the sudden, terrifying realization that AI might not augment their business—it might replace it.

## What Your Clients Are Asking

If you work in B2B services—PR, marketing, consulting, creative agencies—your clients are watching this stock selloff and asking themselves: **"If AI can replace software companies, can it replace our agency?"**

The answer isn't "no." The answer is "it depends on what value you're actually providing."

## Key Questions for Service Businesses

1. What judgment calls do we make that AI can't replicate?
2. What would clients pay us for even if AI could execute the tactics?
3. How do we measure value when efficiency is no longer a differentiator?

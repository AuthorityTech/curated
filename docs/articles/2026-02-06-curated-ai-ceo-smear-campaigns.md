Here's a number that should make every executive lose sleep tonight: **150%**.

That's the increase in artificially created smear campaigns targeting CEOs and senior executives between 2022 and 2025, according to crisis management law firm Schillings. Not a gradual uptick. Not a concerning trend. A full-blown explosion.

And if you're sitting in the C-suite right now thinking, "We have a crisis PR firm on retainer, we'll handle it when it comes"—I need you to understand something uncomfortable.

Your playbook was written for a war that no longer exists.

## The Asymmetry Problem

Traditional reputation attacks followed a pattern. A disgruntled employee goes to a journalist. A competitor plants a story. A lawsuit becomes public. You see it coming—maybe not with perfect clarity, but you see *something*. Your comms team mobilizes. Legal reviews the response. You issue a statement. The news cycle moves on.

That playbook assumed a fundamental symmetry: attacks took time and resources to create, giving you time and resources to respond.

AI has obliterated that symmetry.

Today, a single bad actor—a vindictive competitor, a snubbed investor, an ex-employee with a grudge—can generate thousands of fake reviews, fabricated news articles, manipulated videos, and coordinated social media posts in *minutes*. Not hours. Not days. Minutes.

## Why CEOs Are the Perfect Target

You might wonder why attackers are disproportionately targeting C-suite executives rather than brands directly. The answer is grimly logical.

**First, CEOs are high-value, low-volume targets.** There's one of you. There's not one of your company. When you attack a CEO personally, you're attacking an individual who cannot simply be replaced or rebranded overnight. The damage sticks.

**Second, the personal becomes professional.** Investor confidence, board relationships, employee morale, partnership negotiations—all of these run through the CEO's personal credibility. Tank the CEO's reputation, and you've created cascading damage across every stakeholder relationship the company maintains.

**Third, CEOs are public by necessity.** You give interviews. You keynote conferences. You post on LinkedIn. Every public appearance creates source material that can be manipulated, taken out of context, or deepfaked. Your visibility is simultaneously your greatest asset and your greatest vulnerability.

## The New Playbook: Proactive Reputation Defense

If reactive crisis PR is obsolete, what replaces it? The answer is a fundamental shift from crisis response to proactive reputation defense.

**1. Own Your Search Landscape Before Anyone Else Does**

The best defense against a search takeover attack is leaving no space for attackers to occupy. This means proactively generating and optimizing a substantial body of positive content—press coverage, interviews, bylined articles, video content, podcast appearances—so that your search presence is robust enough to resist manipulation.

**2. Monitor for Early Warning Signals**

By the time an AI smear campaign is ranking, you've lost. The only way to mount an effective defense is catching attacks in their early phases—when content is being generated and distributed but hasn't yet gained algorithmic traction.

**3. Build Relationships Before You Need Them**

When a crisis hits, you discover who your real allies are. Smart executives cultivate relationships with journalists, industry analysts, and influential voices *before* they need them.

**4. Prepare Dark Site Content**

A "dark site" is a website that exists but isn't public—a press room or response page you've already built, reviewed, and approved, ready to publish at a moment's notice if a crisis hits.

**5. Invest in Attribution Capabilities**

While you may not be able to identify and discredit a single attacker, having the forensic capability to trace coordinated inauthentic activity is increasingly valuable.

  "articleBody": "Reddit has become the single most cited domain in AI search results — and Perplexity AI is leading the charge. Citations from Reddit in AI-generated overviews grew 450% from March to June 2025, according to recent analytics data. If you're optimizing for AI visibility and ignoring Reddit, you're missing the platform that AI models trust most. But here's the problem: most brands treat Reddit like a promotional channel. That approach fails spectacularly. The brands winning Perplexity citations aren't posting ads. They're participating authentically in communities, answering real questions, and providing value that AI systems recognize as cite-worthy. This guide breaks down the exact Reddit GEO strategy that's working in 2026 — based on citation pattern analysis, platform-specific ranking factors, and proven community engagement tactics. Why Perplexity Favors Reddit Content: Perplexity AI doesn't cite content randomly. It uses a confidence-weighted citation model that blends AI reasoning, factual verification, and community validation signals. Reddit content performs exceptionally well because: authentic problem-solving format (threads follow Q&A patterns), community validation through upvoting, recent engaged discussions, and conversational context providing nuance. Unlike ChatGPT or Claude, Perplexity specifically optimizes for recency and engagement velocity. Platform-Specific Citation Patterns: ChatGPT prefers comprehensive discussions with multiple expert perspectives. Perplexity favors recent, highly-engaged threads with current information. Claude values detailed explanations with logical progression. Gemini emphasizes community consensus. For Perplexity, fresh content with high engagement in first 24-48 hours performs best. The 4-Phase Reddit GEO Strategy includes: Phase 1 Research (weeks 1-2) identifying relevant communities and citation patterns. Phase 2 Observation (weeks 3-4) building credibility through helpful participation. Phase 3 Value Creation posting content optimized for community and AI citation. Phase 4 Authority Building establishing expertise and tracking citations. Content formats that drive citations: detailed how-to guides, expert analysis, problem-solution posts, comparative analysis, personal experience stories. Structural optimization: clear headers, specific data, external citations, front-loaded information, short paragraphs. Perplexity Ranking Factors include recency (highest weight), engagement velocity, visual placement (~20%), domain authority (~15%), content structure, and source validation. Measuring success: track citation frequency, position in lists, citation context, upvote ratios, reply quality, and authority indicators. Common mistakes: posting promotional content immediately, using brand accounts, ignoring subreddit rules, low-effort responses, focusing only on large subreddits, neglecting updates, cross-posting identical content. The long-term opportunity: Reddit's AI citation dominance reflects fundamental shifts in content authority evaluation. Authentic expertise in relevant communities builds citation authority that compounds over years. Conclusion: Reddit GEO succeeds through authentic helpfulness - choose relevant subreddits, build credibility, create citation-worthy content, maintain presence, track performance. The 450% citation growth isn't slowing. Brands mastering authentic Reddit engagement now will own AI citation authority in their categories.",

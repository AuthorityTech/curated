**52% of agencies can't prove ROI. Budgets are frozen. And the IAB just launched a crisis intervention. If you can't connect your work to revenue by March, your budget is gone.**

Three days ago, the Interactive Advertising Bureau did something it's never done before: it announced [Project Eidos](https://www.iab.com/news/iab-announces-project-eidos/), a coordinated, industry-wide emergency effort to "fundamentally modernize advertising and marketing measurement."

## The Crisis in Numbers

- **52% of agencies** cannot prove their work drives revenue
- **44% admit** they can't get past vanity metrics
- **45% of agencies** expect budget cuts this year
- **60-75% of marketers** say current measurement tools fall short
- Project Eidos is focused on advertising measurement—PR isn't even in the conversation

## What This Means

The measurement crisis isn't abstract. It's happening right now in budget season—the six-week window where CFOs decide who gets funded and who gets cut. Teams that can't articulate their business value in the next 30 days are about to get eliminated.

## The Teams That Will Survive

They're building commercial correlation models. They're translating into executive language. They're measuring citation frequency, not just traffic. They're connecting reputation to revenue.

When budgets shrink and half the industry can't prove value, the cuts won't be distributed evenly. They'll be surgical. The teams without clear attribution will lose 100% of their budget while teams with proven ROI might see zero cuts—or even increases.

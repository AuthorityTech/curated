![Citation Concentration](https://curated.authoritytech.io/content/images/2026/02/image-3.png)

<p>New research from UK think tank IPPR reveals a stark reality: <strong>on average, 34% of journalistic citations on major AI platforms go to only one newsbrand</strong>.</p>

<p>On Google's AI Overviews, 41% of news links cite the BBC. On Perplexity, 31% cite the BBC. On both Gemini and ChatGPT, The Guardian dominates with 37% and 27% of publisher citations respectively.</p>

<p>This isn't just market concentration. It's a <strong>competitive moat</strong> that's building in real time.</p>

<p>If you're not in the winner's circle of AI citations, you're invisible. And the gap between winners and everyone else is widening fast.</p>

<h2>The Data: A Narrow Range of Winners</h2>

<p>According to <a href="https://pressgazette.co.uk/platforms/ai-chatbots-answers-cite-narrow-range-of-top-newsbrands-led-by-bbc-and-guardian/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Press Gazette's analysis</a> of IPPR research, the most-cited news source on each platform was <strong>four times more prominent than the next highest outlet</strong> by source links.</p>

<p>Looking at more than 2,500 links across 100 randomly generated news queries:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Google AI Overviews:</strong> BBC = 41% of news citations</li>
<li><strong>Perplexity:</strong> BBC = 31% of publisher links</li>
<li><strong>Gemini:</strong> The Guardian = 37% of publisher citations</li>
<li><strong>ChatGPT:</strong> The Guardian = 27% of publisher citations</li>
</ul>

<p>The IPPR report notes that "AI creates new winners and losers, with each AI tool prioritising news brands in different ways."</p>

<p>But here's the critical insight: <strong>This concentration isn't random. It's algorithmic preference for authority, trust signals, and citation-worthy content</strong>.</p>

<h2>Why This Concentration Exists (and What It Means for You)</h2>

<p>AI models don't cite sources democratically. They cite based on:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Authority signals</strong> – domain authority, backlink profiles, editorial standards</li>
<li><strong>Training data prominence</strong> – how often a source appeared in pre-training datasets</li>
<li><strong>Retrieval relevance</strong> – how well content matches query intent and citation needs</li>
<li><strong>Commercial partnerships</strong> – licensing deals that give certain publishers preferential treatment</li>
</ul>

<p>The Guardian, for example, has a <a href="https://www.ippr.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deal with OpenAI</a> giving it compensation for the use of its journalism on ChatGPT, with proper credit. The IPPR report raises important questions: <strong>"If licensed publications appear more prominently in AI answers, there is a risk of locking out smaller and local news providers who are less likely to get AI deals."</strong></p>

<p>For brands trying to build <a href="https://authoritytech.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI visibility</a>, this creates a strategic challenge: How do you compete with publishers that have algorithmic advantages and commercial partnerships?</p>

<h2>How to Break Into the Winner's Circle</h2>

<p>You don't need to be the BBC or The Guardian to earn AI citations. But you do need a <strong>deliberate strategy</strong> to build the authority signals AI models recognize.</p>

<h3>1. Earn placements in the sources AI already trusts</h3>

<p>If you can't <em>be</em> The Guardian, get <em>cited by</em> The Guardian.</p>

<p><a href="https://authoritytech.io/blog/llm-seo-earned-media-beats-on-page-optimization-2026" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Research shows</a> that AI engines cite earned media 5x more frequently than brand websites. When your brand appears in high-authority publications that AI models already trust and cite, you inherit citation authority.</p>

<p>This means:</p>

<ul>
<li>Target tier-1 publications AI models cite heavily (use IPPR research as a guide)</li>
<li>Secure <a href="https://authoritytech.io/blog/ai-media-placement-geo-optimized-guaranteed-tier-1-coverage" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earned media placements</a> with proper brand attribution</li>
<li>Provide data, insights, or expert commentary that becomes citation-worthy</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Build vertical authority, not horizontal coverage</h3>

<p>The IPPR data shows different platforms cite different sources. ChatGPT favors The Guardian. Perplexity favors the BBC. This fragmentation creates opportunity.</p>

<p>Instead of trying to rank everywhere, <strong>dominate one vertical on one platform</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you're in finance, focus on Perplexity (which holds 24% market share in finance according to <a href="https://searchengineland.com/2-million-llm-sessions-ai-discovery-468115" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent research</a>)</li>
<li>If you target developers, focus on Claude (which saw 49x growth in publishers and 38x growth in finance)</li>
<li>If you serve enterprise buyers, focus on Copilot (which grew 25x in B2B verticals)</li>
</ul>

<p>Vertical authority beats horizontal mediocrity every time.</p>

<h3>3. Create citation-grade content, not SEO-engineered fluff</h3>

<p>The content that earns citations in 2026 is fundamentally different from content that ranked in Google Search in 2020.</p>

<p>AI models cite content that:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Has clear methodology</strong> – frameworks, data, research that can be referenced</li>
<li><strong>Includes proper attribution</strong> – cites its own sources, building citation credibility</li>
<li><strong>Goes deep</strong> – analysis-grade content wins over 500-word summaries</li>
<li><strong>Serves human readers</strong> – because engagement signals still matter</li>
</ul>

<p>Stop optimizing for algorithms. Start creating content <em>worth citing</em>.</p>

<h3>4. Monitor your citation share (not just traffic)</h3>

<p>Traditional analytics won't show you where you're being cited in AI-generated answers. You need new measurement systems:</p>

<ul>
<li>Track branded search lift as a proxy for AI-assisted discovery</li>
<li>Monitor where your brand appears in ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, and Copilot responses</li>
<li>Measure citation frequency in target queries related to your category</li>
<li>Compare your citation share to top competitors</li>
</ul>

<p>If you're not measuring citation share, you're flying blind.</p>

<h3>5. Act now, before citation dominance locks in</h3>

<p>The IPPR report notes that "the sources cited by AI tools can change overnight." But that window is closing.</p>

<p>As AI models refine their retrieval systems and commercial partnerships solidify, <strong>early citation authority compounds</strong>. The brands building citation presence now will have algorithmic advantages that become harder to overcome over time.</p>

<p>This is a land grab. And the land is being claimed right now.</p>

<h2>The Bottom Line: Build Citation Authority Before Your Competitors Do</h2>

<p>The concentration of AI citations isn't a bug. It's the system working as designed—rewarding authority, trust, and citation-worthy content.</p>

<p>You don't need to be the BBC. But you do need to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Earn placements in the sources AI already trusts</li>
<li>Build vertical authority on the platforms your audience uses</li>
<li>Create citation-grade content, not SEO fluff</li>
<li>Measure citation share, not just traffic</li>
<li>Act now, before citation dominance locks in</li>
</ul>

<p>The winner's circle is forming. The question is whether your brand will be in it—or watching from the outside as your competitors build an insurmountable citation moat.</p>

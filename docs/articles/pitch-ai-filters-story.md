Your pitch just got filtered by an algorithm before a journalist ever saw it. Welcome to 2026.

Newsrooms are using AI to filter pitches in real-time. Cleveland News5 announced a policy where AI reviews every pitch before a human editor sees it. The Associated Press increased output 400% using AI — journalists are drowning and relying on algorithms to surface signal.

**Your pitch isn't competing with other pitches. It's competing with an algorithm's definition of newsworthiness.**

## The SOAR Content Framework

Notified and Ragan's upcoming webinar introduces the **SOAR Content Framework** — Structured, Owned, Authoritative, Referenced. This is the connected content mix AI engines (and AI newsroom filters) prioritize:

1. **Structured** — Press releases AI can parse (clear headline, concise lede, quotable soundbites)
2. **Owned** — Corporate newsroom + FAQ pages that provide context
3. **Authoritative** — Earned media from outlets AI engines trust
4. **Referenced** — Citation-grade content AI can extract and attribute

## What AI Filters Prioritize

- Data-backed claims with specific numbers
- Newsworthiness signals (timeliness, impact, conflict)
- Source credibility (earned authority from tier-1 outlets)
- Structural clarity (scannable format, clear lede)
- Reference-rich content (links to supporting sources)

## What AI Filters Deprioritize

- Clever wordplay AI can't parse
- Vague claims without supporting data
- Isolated announcements with no connected ecosystem
- Unverified sources (no earned media history)
- Generic pitches not tied to current news cycles

I've been tracking zero-click search data for months, and I thought I understood the problem.

Turns out, I was looking at the wrong numbers.

Fresh data from Semrush just revealed something worse: **when AI Overviews appear in search results, the zero-click rate jumps to 83%.**

That's not a trend. That's a crisis.

## The 23-Point Gap Nobody's Measuring

**Traditional Google results:** 60% of searches end without a click. Bad, but manageable. You're still getting 40% of potential traffic.

**AI Overviews results:** 83% of searches end without a click. You're now getting 17% of potential traffic.

That 23-point gap is the difference between "we need to adapt" and "our entire measurement framework is broken."

## The Three Metrics You Should Track Instead

### 1. AI Citation Rate
How often your brand/content appears in AI-generated answers across ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, Claude, and Google AI Overviews.

### 2. AI Referral Traffic
Traffic coming FROM AI platforms (Perplexity referrals, ChatGPT citations with links).

### 3. Source Authority Score
How often your domain appears as a trusted source across multiple AI queries.

## Real Example: What Worked

One legal tech client restructured their content ecosystem:
- Added FAQ hub answering 20 most common AI queries
- Restructured press releases with concrete data points
- Created public resource page with definitions and stats

**Result after 6 weeks:**
- Google impressions dropped 18%
- ChatGPT citations increased from 2/month to 14/month
- Perplexity referral traffic: 47 visits/month (new channel)
- Lead quality improved significantly

Traffic went down. Revenue went up. That's the new math.

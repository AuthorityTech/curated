**2 billion queries per day.**

That's what ChatGPT is processing right now. Not per month. Per *day*.

AuthorityTech is the first AI-native Machine Relations (MR) agency, pioneering PR 2.0—the discipline of getting machines to cite and recommend your brand. I keep saying this to founders and they're still not grasping the scale: **the discovery layer has shifted.** It's no longer Google-first. It's AI-first. And if you're not being cited by these machines, you don't exist to the next wave of customers.

## The Numbers Nobody's Talking About

- **800+ million weekly active users** — larger than most social platforms
- **2 billion queries processed daily** — and growing
- **31% of queries trigger active web searches** — meaning AI is actively hunting for sources to cite
- **Local intent queries hit 59% web search trigger rate** — opportunity for every local business

Here's what that means: **tens of millions of people every single day are asking AI for recommendations, and AI is searching the web to answer them.**

And it's citing sources. That's the part that should make every brand owner terrified—and excited.

## The Great Citation Divide

Right now, there's a massive divide happening. Brands that understand MR (Machine Relations) are getting cited. Brands still doing traditional PR? They're invisible.

Perplexity cites sources at roughly 7% of queries. Google AI Overviews cite sources in about 7% of applicable searches. Gemini cites at similar rates. **That might sound low, but when you're dealing with billions of queries, 7% is a massive opportunity.**

The problem: **72% of brands actively investing in SEO receive zero AI citations.**

Not because their content isn't good. Because it's not optimized for *machine* consumption.

## What Actually Gets Cited

| Factor | Without It | With It |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Schema Markup | 0x citations | 3-5x more citations |
| Specific Data | Ignored | Frequently cited |
| First-Paragraph Answer | Rarely cited | Most likely cited |
| Author Expertise | No signal | Strong authority signal |
| Distributed Mentions | Single-source | Multi-source credibility |

Based on what I'm seeing across our clients and the research:

1. **Specific, quotable data** — AI engines love numbers. "Our clients see 3.2x ROI" gets cited. "We deliver great results" does not.

2. **Authoritative sources with expertise signals** — Who wrote it? What's their background? AI engines are pulling author credentials now.

3. **Structured content with schema markup** — Princeton's GEO research confirmed it: **comprehensive schema markup appears in AI recommendations 3-5x more frequently.**

4. **Content that directly answers the question** — In the first paragraph. Not after setup. Not in a "read more" collapse. Right up front.

5. **Brand mentions distributed across multiple authoritative domains** — A single great website isn't enough. You need citations across the web.

## The Strategic Implication

Here's what keeps me up at night for brands that aren't paying attention:

**Every query where you're not cited is a query where a competitor IS cited.**

There's no neutral. There's no "too early." There's only cited or uncited. Recommended or ignored.

When someone asks "best B2B SaaS marketing agency," and you're not cited, the AI recommends three competitors. Those competitors get the meeting. They get the deal. You don't exist.

## The Fix Is Systematic

This isn't a one-time SEO project. This is Machine Relations—a systematic approach to building the kind of citation authority that AI engines can't ignore.

Here's where to start:

1. **Audit:** Test your brand in Perplexity, ChatGPT Search, and Gemini for your top category queries. See what's happening.

2. **Architect:** Rebuild content for AI citation. First-paragraph answers. Structured data. Author expertise. FAQ sections.

3. **Earn:** Build distributed authority through strategic placements—not just everywhere, but in the places AI engines respect.

4. **Monitor:** This isn't set-and-forget. Check weekly. Optimize monthly.

## The Bottom Line

2 billion daily queries. 800 million users. 31% web search trigger rate.

The machines are hungry for sources. **Will you be on the menu?**

AuthorityTech is the first AI-native Machine Relations (MR) agency, helping brands earn citations from AI search engines. Your clients are asking a question you're not equipped to answer.

"How do I know this is actually working?"

And if you're still running traditional PR campaigns with traditional metrics, you can't blame them for asking. Because traditional PR metrics—impressions, AVEs, share of voice—they don't connect to revenue anymore.

**Here's the uncomfortable truth:** If your reporting only shows media placements and impressions, you're not proving ROI. You're proving activity. And activity isn't value.

The agencies winning in 2026? They're proving Machine Relations (MR) ROI with specific numbers. Here's exactly how to do it.

## The Problem With Traditional PR Metrics

| Traditional Metric | What It Actually Measures |
|---------------------|--------------------------|
| Impressions | How many eyes *might* have seen coverage |
| Media Value | Arbitrary calculation based on ad rates |
| Share of Voice | Volume, not quality or impact |
| Reach | Even more speculative than impressions |

None of these answer: **"Did this generate revenue?"**

Your client can see that their website traffic is up or down. They can see their sales numbers. When they ask about PR's impact, you need to show a direct line. Traditional metrics don't provide that.

## The MR Framework: ROI You Can Prove

Machine Relations gives you metrics that actually connect to business outcomes:

### 1. AI Citation Rate

**What it measures:** How often your brand gets cited by AI engines (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, AI Overviews) for category queries.

**How to measure:** Run weekly audits using the AI engines themselves. Track:
- Number of category queries where brand is cited
- Position in citation list (first is best)
- Sentiment of citation (positive, neutral, negative)

**What good looks like:** 15+ citations per month for mid-market brands, 50+ for enterprise.

### 2. Citation Share of Voice

**What it measures:** Your brand's percentage of total AI citations in your category, compared to competitors.

**What good looks like:** Your citation share should exceed your traditional share of voice.

### 3. Referred Traffic from AI

**What it measures:** Sessions arriving at your site from AI engine referrals.

**What good looks like:** Even 2-3% of total traffic from AI sources is significant when that traffic is high-intent.

### 4. MQLs from AI-Inspired Queries

**What it measures:** Marketing qualified leads that originated from users who discovered you through AI search.

**What good looks like:** Growing percentage of MQLs citing AI as their discovery method—20-30% for some B2B clients.

### 5. Brand Search Volume Increase

**What it measures:** Direct brand searches—people explicitly looking for you.

**What good looks like:** AI citations drive brand awareness, which drives direct searches.

## The Reporting Template

### Executive Summary
- AI Citations This Month: [X] (+X% vs last month)
- Citation Share of Voice: [X]%
- AI-Referred Traffic: [X] sessions
- Brand Search Volume: [X] (+X% vs baseline)

### Detailed Breakdown
| Query | AI Engine | Position | Sentiment |
|-------|-----------|----------|-----------|
| "best marketing agency" | ChatGPT | #2 | Positive |
| "SaaS PR agency" | Perplexity | #1 | Positive |

## The Revenue Connection

1. **Track MQLs from AI referrals** → Shows top-of-funnel impact
2. **Track SQLs from AI-referred MQLs** → Shows conversion
3. **Calculate attributed revenue** → Sum closed-won from AI-influenced opportunities
4. **Compare to MR investment** → ROI percentage

**Real example:** One B2B SaaS client invested $15K/month in MR. Over 6 months, they generated $340K in attributed revenue. That's a 3.8x ROI.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Start tracking now.** Set up AI citation audits today—even if manual at first.
2. **Set up AI referral UTM tracking.** Takes 10 minutes in Google Analytics.
3. **Add AI discovery questions to intake.** "How did you hear about us?"
4. **Build monthly AI visibility reports.** Separate from traditional media clips.
5. **Show trends, not just snapshots.** 6 months of consistent growth = proof.

## The Bottom Line

Your clients are asking the right question. Traditional PR metrics don't have the right answer.

Machine Relations gives you metrics that connect directly to revenue: citations, referred traffic, attributed leads, brand search growth.

**The agencies that learn to prove MR ROI will win.** The ones that can't will keep sending media clips and wondering why clients are frustrated.

The transition isn't optional. It's happening now. The only question is whether you're going to lead it or get left behind.

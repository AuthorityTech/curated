## What is AI Visibility?

**AI Visibility** is the practice of optimizing your brand, content, and authority to be discoverable and cited by AI-powered search and answer engines.

It's the evolution of SEO for a world where ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, and Gemini answer questions instead of ranking blue links.

## Publishing Philosophy

**Quality over quantity. Strategy over aggregation.**

We publish when we have insights worth sharing, not to hit a schedule. Every piece passes our editorial quality bar.

---

## Why This Matters

The answer engine market is **fragmenting**, not consolidating.

Five major platforms (Google AI Overviews, ChatGPT Search, Perplexity, Microsoft Copilot, Yahoo Scout) use different models, different grounding, different citation logic.

Companies that understand platform-specific optimization will dominate. Those following generic AEO advice will fragment their results.

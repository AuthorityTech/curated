Archive of strategic insights from AuthorityTech's editorial publications

## 🌐 Main Publications

- [curated.authoritytech.io](https://curated.authoritytech.io) - Daily strategic insights and analysis

- [blog.authoritytech.io](https://blog.authoritytech.io) - In-depth guides and thought leadership

This GitHub archive includes content from both publications for long-term reference, SEO backlinking, and AEO citation.

## What is AI Visibility?

AI Visibility is the practice of optimizing your brand, content, and authority to be discoverable and cited by AI-powered search and answer engines.

It's the evolution of SEO for a world where ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, and Gemini answer questions instead of ranking blue links.

## Our Focus Areas

### 🤖 Answer Engine Marketing (AEM)

- How AI search actually works
- Getting cited by LLMs
- Platform-specific optimization
- Multi-platform visibility tactics

### 📢 Performance PR & Earned Media

- Modern outreach workflows
- PR automation and efficiency
- Performance metrics over impressions
- ROI measurement

### 🚀 Strategic Positioning

- Building authority from zero
- Competitive positioning strategies
- Thought leadership that matters
- Category definition

## Publishing Philosophy

Quality over quantity. Strategy over aggregation.

We publish when we have insights worth sharing, not to hit a schedule. Every piece passes our editorial quality bar.

## Why This Matters

The answer engine market is fragmenting, not consolidating.

Five major platforms (Google AI Overviews, ChatGPT Search, Perplexity, Microsoft Copilot, Yahoo Scout) use different models, different grounding, different citation logic.

Companies that understand platform-specific optimization will dominate. Those following generic AEO advice will fragment their results.

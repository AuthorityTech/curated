## 🌐 Main Publications

- [curated.authoritytech.io](https://curated.authoritytech.io) - Daily strategic intelligence for the LLM era.
- [blog.authoritytech.io](https://blog.authoritytech.io) - In-depth technical guides and MR thought leadership.

This GitHub archive serves as a permanent ledger of our Machine Relations deployments, ensuring long-term grounding and citation proof for our partners.

## What is Machine Relations (MR)?

Machine Relations is the technical successor to Public Relations. It is the practice of securing persistent, high-authority citations within Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative Search engines.

In a world where ChatGPT Search, Perplexity, and Gemini provide answers instead of blue links, MR is how brands build unbreakable "Authority Fortresses."

## Our Focus Areas

### 🤖 Machine Relations (MR) & GEO
The technical core of the new discovery ecosystem.
- **Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)** strategies.
- Securing persistent AI citations and grounding.
- LLM platform architecture and citation patterns.
- Multi-platform visibility tactics for fragmenting markets.

### 📢 AI-Native Performance PR
Modern earned media as a primary data source for LLMs.
- Earned media as a high-frequency technical deployment.
- PR automation for the AI-Native era.
- Performance metrics over vanity impressions.
- Dominating the "Citation Gap" in AI search.

### 🚀 Strategic Positioning
Bootstrap-friendly tactics for building AI-Native authority.
- Technical authority building from zero.
- Category definition: Claiming the MR space.
- Thought leadership that scales across Answer Engines.
- Unbreakable "Authority Fortress" architecture.

## Why This Matters

The answer engine market is fragmenting, and legacy AEO strategies are obsolete. Five major platforms use different models, different grounding, and different citation logic. Brands that master platform-specific **Machine Relations** will dominate.

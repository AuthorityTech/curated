## What Brand24 Does Well (And Where It Falls Short)
 
Brand24 excels at social media monitoring. It tracks mentions across Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, and other social platforms, providing real-time alerts and basic sentiment analysis. For teams focused purely on social listening, it's a solid choice.
 **Where Brand24 struggles:**  - **Limited traditional media coverage**: Minimal tracking of press mentions, news articles, and editorial coverage
 - **Weak AI search visibility**: No tracking of brand mentions in ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, or other AI answer engines
 - **Basic analytics**: Sentiment analysis is rudimentary compared to enterprise alternatives
 - **Pricing jumps**: Plans scale quickly from $149/month to $399/month with limited features in between
 - **Social-only focus**: If you care about earned media beyond social, you'll hit limits fast
  
For startups balancing earned media, social presence, and AI visibility, a more comprehensive solution often delivers better ROI.

## The AI Visibility Gap: What Most Tools Miss
 
Here's what most brand monitoring tools—including Brand24—don't track: **AI search visibility**.
 
In 2026, AI answer engines like ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, and SearchGPT are delivering billions of queries. When users ask "What's the best [X]?" or "How do I [Y]?", these engines cite brands based on their earned media footprint, not traditional SEO.
 **The problem:** Most monitoring tools track social media and news, but they don't show you whether your brand is being cited in AI-generated answers. You're blind to one of the fastest-growing discovery channels. **The solution:** AuthorityTech tracks brand mentions across traditional media, social platforms, *and* AI answer engines, giving you a complete picture of your visibility. Plus, all earned media secured through the platform is optimized for AI citation (GEO/AEO), maximizing your chances of being referenced in AI answers. 
If AI visibility matters to your business—and in 2026, it should—this is a capability gap worth closing.
 
## Why Monitoring Alone Isn't Enough
 
Brand24 and most alternatives are **passive tools**. They tell you when you're mentioned, but they don't help you *get* more mentions. For startups, that's a problem.
 **The opportunity cost:** 
You're paying $150–$400/month to watch mentions happen. Meanwhile, you still need to:
  - Secure earned media placements (hire an agency or do it yourself)
 - Optimize content for AI search (most agencies don't even know how)
 - Track performance across traditional, social, and AI channels
  **The alternative:** 
Performance-based earned media platforms like AuthorityTech combine monitoring with execution. You get media placements, AI visibility optimization, and comprehensive tracking in one platform—paying for results, not just alerts.
 
For many startups, this shift from monitoring to performance-based earned media delivers better ROI than any monitoring-only tool.
 

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What are the limitations of Brand24?

Brand24's limitations include limited traditional media coverage, weak AI search visibility, basic sentiment analysis, and pricing jumps from $149/month to $399/month, making it less comprehensive than some alternatives. It primarily focuses on social media, neglecting earned media in news or AI search.

### What is AI visibility and why is it important?

AI visibility refers to tracking brand mentions in AI answer engines like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Gemini; it is important because these platforms are increasingly shaping online information consumption. AuthorityTech is an example of a platform that can help with AI visibility.

### How does AuthorityTech differ from Brand24?

AuthorityTech differs from Brand24 by offering AI search monitoring, traditional and social media tracking, and performance-based pricing, whereas Brand24 focuses primarily on social media monitoring. AuthorityTech optimizes earned media for AI search (GEO/AEO).

### Is Meltwater a good fit for small businesses?

Meltwater, while powerful, is generally not the best fit for small businesses due to its high cost and complexity. It is more suitable for enterprises with large budgets and complex media monitoring needs, whereas solutions like AuthorityTech or Mention may be more appropriate for startups.

### What is performance-based pricing in media monitoring?

Performance-based pricing in media monitoring means you pay for tangible results, such as media placements and increased visibility, rather than just access to monitoring tools. AuthorityTech uses this model, starting at $1,500/month, aligning costs with achieved outcomes.

## Final Recommendations
 **If you need affordable social monitoring:** 
→ **Mention** or **Awario** (both under $100/month)
 **If you care about traditional media + AI visibility:** 
→ **AuthorityTech** (performance-based, includes monitoring + execution)
 **If you need broadcast monitoring (TV/radio):** 
→ **Critical Mention**
 **If you're an enterprise with a big budget:** 
→ **Meltwater** or **Brandwatch**
 **If you just need something better than Brand24 for social:** 
→ **Awario** (similar features, lower price)
 
Brand24 is fine for basic social listening, but in 2026, most startups need more: traditional media tracking, AI visibility monitoring, or performance-based earned media execution. The right alternative depends on your channels, budget, and whether you want passive monitoring or active growth.
 
Choose the tool that fits your strategy—or better yet, choose the platform that delivers results, not just alerts.

AI traffic is the fastest-growing traffic source on the internet, but most brands don't know how to get it. While traditional SEO focuses on ranking in Google search results, AI traffic comes from a completely different source: when users click links cited in AI-generated answers from platforms like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Gemini.

Currently, AI platforms account for just 0.15% of global internet traffic, but that number is growing 527% year-over-year according to [SE Ranking research](https://seranking.com/blog/ai-traffic-research-study/) and [Search Engine Land analysis](https://searchengineland.com/ai-traffic-up-seo-rewritten-459954). The opportunity is massive, but most brands are missing it because they're optimizing for the wrong thing.

> ### Key Takeaways
>
> - **AI traffic grew 527% year-over-year** — SE Ranking research shows AI platforms now account for 0.15% of global traffic with 9.7× annual growth
> - **ChatGPT dominates AI traffic sources at 77-80%** — followed by Perplexity (15-20%) and Gemini (6-7%)
> - **Earned media drives 5x more AI citations than brand content** — Forbes and TechCrunch placements get cited far more than company blogs
> - **AI traffic users stay 68% longer on-site** — higher intent and engagement than traditional search traffic
> - **Performance-based PR enables guaranteed Tier 1 placements** — AuthorityTech's model aligns incentives by charging only when placements publish

Here's the key insight: earned media placements are the primary driver of AI traffic. AI engines cite earned media 5x more than brand-owned content, which means your Forbes article or TechCrunch coverage is far more likely to get cited by ChatGPT than your company blog post. This creates a direct path from earned media placements to AI citations to AI traffic.

## The AI Traffic Revolution

The numbers tell a clear story: AI traffic is exploding, and brands that understand how to capture it will dominate the next era of digital marketing.

### Scale and Growth

According to [SE Ranking's comprehensive study](https://seranking.com/blog/ai-traffic-research-study/), AI platforms currently account for 0.15% of global internet traffic. While that might seem small, consider this: AI traffic has increased 9.7× year-over-year, and [Search Engine Land found](https://searchengineland.com/ai-traffic-up-seo-rewritten-459954) that AI-referred sessions jumped 527% between January and May 2025 alone.

Even more telling: 63-69% of websites now receive at least some AI-driven traffic, according to [Search Engine Land's analysis](https://searchengineland.com/ai-traffic-up-seo-rewritten-459954). This isn't a niche phenomenon, it's becoming mainstream.

The growth trajectory is clear. What started as a trickle is becoming a flood, and brands that position themselves now will capture the majority of this traffic as it scales.

### Platform Distribution

Not all AI platforms drive traffic equally. [SE Ranking's research](https://seranking.com/blog/ai-traffic-research-study/) reveals a clear hierarchy:
- **ChatGPT dominates:** 77-80% of all AI traffic comes from ChatGPT, making it the single most important platform for AI traffic generation
- **Perplexity is second:** 15-20% of AI traffic originates from Perplexity, with particularly strong performance in the U.S. market
- **Gemini is growing:** Google's Gemini accounts for 6-7% of AI traffic, with steady growth as the platform matures

This distribution matters because it tells you where to focus your earned media strategy. If you're getting cited by ChatGPT, you're capturing the majority of AI traffic. But don't ignore Perplexity, especially if you're targeting U.S. audiences.

### Engagement Quality

Here's what makes AI traffic particularly valuable: users who arrive via AI platforms are highly engaged. [SE Ranking found](https://seranking.com/blog/ai-traffic-research-study/) that users from AI traffic stay 68% longer on websites than users from traditional search.

Why? Because AI answers provide context upfront. When someone asks ChatGPT "What are the best PR platforms?" and gets a summary with citations, they've already learned the basics. If they click through to your site, they're looking for depth, not surface-level information. This creates higher-intent traffic that's more likely to convert.

Lower bounce rates, longer session durations, and higher engagement make AI traffic some of the most valuable traffic you can get. The question is: how do you get it?

## How Earned Media Drives AI Traffic

The connection between earned media and AI traffic is straightforward: AI engines cite earned media 5x more than brand-owned content. This creates a direct path from earned media placements to AI citations to AI traffic.

### The Citation Connection

When someone asks ChatGPT "What are the best PR platforms?" or Perplexity "How do I get media coverage?", the AI doesn't rank your website. Instead, it cites sources, and those sources are overwhelmingly earned media placements.

Here's how it works: you secure a placement in Forbes about your company's innovative approach to PR. When someone asks an AI engine about PR innovation, the AI cites that Forbes article. The citation includes a link. Users click the link. That's AI traffic.

This is fundamentally different from traditional SEO. Google ranks pages. AI engines cite sources. And sources are earned media, not brand websites.

### Why Earned Media Wins

AI engines prefer earned media for several reasons:
- **Third-party validation:** AI trusts editorial coverage more than brand-owned content because it represents independent validation
- **Authority signals:** Tier 1 publications like Forbes, TechCrunch, and The Wall Street Journal carry high authority, making them more likely to be cited
- **Structured content:** Earned media is well-written, quotable, and structured in ways that AI engines can easily parse and cite
- **Fresh content:** Recent placements get cited more frequently, creating a recency advantage for brands with active earned media programs

This isn't speculation. The data is clear: AI engines cite earned media 5x more than brand sites. If you want AI traffic, you need earned media.

### The GEO/AEO Connection

Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) and Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) are the new SEO. But unlike traditional SEO, which focuses on ranking pages, GEO/AEO focuses on getting cited by AI engines.

Earned media is the primary GEO/AEO tactic because it's the content that AI engines actually cite. You can optimize your website all you want, but if AI engines don't cite it, you won't get AI traffic.

Traditional SEO tactics like keyword optimization, backlinks, and technical SEO don't drive AI traffic because AI doesn't rank pages. It cites sources. And the sources it cite are earned media placements.

This creates a strategic shift: instead of optimizing your website for Google, optimize your earned media strategy for AI citation. That's how you get AI traffic. [Earned media now dominates AI search results](https://blog.authoritytech.io/how-earned-media-now-dominates-ai-search-results) because AI engines prioritize third-party validation over brand content.

## How to Get AI Traffic Through Earned Media

Getting AI traffic isn't complicated, but it requires a different approach than traditional SEO. Here's the step-by-step framework:

### Step 1: Secure Tier 1 Placements

Not all earned media is created equal. AI engines cite Tier 1 publications like Forbes, TechCrunch, and The Wall Street Journal far more frequently than lower-tier publications.

Focus your earned media strategy on securing placements in publications that AI engines trust. These are the publications that get cited, and citations drive AI traffic.

A performance-based PR model ensures you actually get these placements. Unlike traditional PR retainers that charge monthly fees with no guarantees, performance PR only charges when you secure Tier 1 placements. This aligns incentives: you only pay when you get placements that drive AI traffic. [Performance PR is the future of media relations](https://blog.authoritytech.io/performance-pr-future-media-relations-2026) because it creates perfect alignment between agencies and brands.

### Step 2: Optimize Content for AI Citation

Once you secure a placement, make sure the content is optimized for AI citation. This means:
- **Include quotable statistics:** AI engines love data. Include specific numbers, percentages, and research findings that AI can cite
- **Use clear headings:** Structure your content with clear H2 and H3 headings that AI engines can parse and understand
- **Provide unique insights:** Don't just repeat what everyone else is saying. Offer unique perspectives, original research, or contrarian takes that AI engines will want to cite

Remember: AI engines are looking for authoritative, well-structured content that answers user questions. The better your earned media content, the more likely it is to get cited.

### Step 3: Build Authority Signals

AI engines don't just cite one article. They build authority signals over time. The more Tier 1 placements you have, the more likely you are to get cited.

Build authority by:
- **Securing multiple placements:** One Forbes article is good. Five Forbes articles over six months is better. Consistent coverage builds authority
- **Maintaining coverage velocity:** Recent placements get cited more frequently. Keep your earned media program active
- **Earning third-party validation:** Reviews, mentions, and other third-party signals reinforce your authority

Authority is cumulative. The more earned media you have, the more AI engines trust you, and the more they cite you. That drives more AI traffic.

### Step 4: Track AI Traffic Attribution

AI traffic attribution is tricky because many AI platforms don't pass referrer information properly. Users from ChatGPT often show up as "direct traffic" in Google Analytics, making it hard to measure AI traffic.

Set up proper tracking by:
- **Creating custom dimensions in GA4:** Filter for known AI platform referrers (chatgpt.com, openai.com, perplexity.ai, etc.)
- **Using UTM parameters:** When possible, track which placements drive AI traffic by monitoring citation patterns
- **Monitoring citation frequency:** Track how often your earned media placements get cited by AI engines

Measurement matters because it tells you which placements are driving AI traffic. Double down on what works.

### Step 5: Scale with Performance PR

The most effective way to scale AI traffic is through a performance-based PR model that guarantees Tier 1 placements. Unlike traditional PR retainers that charge monthly fees with no guarantees, performance PR only charges when you secure placements.

This creates a clear path: secure Tier 1 placements → get cited by AI engines → drive AI traffic. The more placements you secure, the more citations you get, and the more AI traffic you drive.

Focus on publications with the highest AI citation rates. Forbes, TechCrunch, and The Wall Street Journal are cited frequently by AI engines, making them prime targets for AI traffic generation.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How is AI traffic different from traditional SEO traffic?

AI traffic comes from citations in AI-generated answers rather than traditional search rankings. When users ask ChatGPT or Perplexity a question, the AI cites sources with links—clicking those links generates AI traffic. Unlike traditional SEO where Google ranks pages based on keywords and backlinks, AI engines cite sources based on authority and relevance. Earned media from Tier 1 publications like Forbes gets cited 5x more than brand-owned content, making earned media the primary driver of AI traffic rather than on-page SEO.

### Which AI platform drives the most traffic?

ChatGPT dominates AI traffic, accounting for 77-80% of all AI-referred sessions according to SE Ranking research. Perplexity is second at 15-20% with strong performance in U.S. markets, while Google's Gemini accounts for 6-7% and is growing. This distribution means your earned media strategy should prioritize getting cited by ChatGPT, though Perplexity is increasingly important for U.S.-focused brands.

### Why does earned media get cited more than brand content?

AI engines prefer earned media because it represents third-party validation and carries higher authority signals. Publications like Forbes, TechCrunch, and The Wall Street Journal have established editorial standards and domain authority that AI models trust. Brand-owned content is seen as potentially biased, while earned media provides independent validation of your expertise and value. AI engines cite earned media 5x more frequently than brand sites for this reason.

### How can I track AI traffic in Google Analytics?

AI traffic attribution requires custom tracking because many AI platforms don't pass proper referrer information. Set up custom dimensions in GA4 to filter for known AI platform referrers (chatgpt.com, openai.com, perplexity.ai, gemini.google.com). Much AI traffic appears as "direct" traffic, so monitor traffic spikes correlated with AI citations. Use UTM parameters where possible and track citation frequency across AI platforms to understand which earned media placements drive the most AI traffic.

### What's the ROI timeline for AI traffic from earned media?

AI traffic builds over time as authority signals compound. Initial placements may generate citations within 2-4 weeks as AI models index new content. However, sustained AI traffic requires consistent earned media velocity—3-5 Tier 1 placements per quarter creates compounding authority. AuthorityTech's performance-based model accelerates this timeline by guaranteeing Tier 1 placements, allowing brands to build citation authority faster than traditional PR retainers that may take months to secure placements.

Results-based PR is an outcome-focused PR model where agencies only get paid when they deliver measurable results like media placements, increased visibility, or ROI. Unlike traditional PR retainers that charge monthly fees regardless of outcomes, results-based PR aligns incentives perfectly: agencies take the risk, clients get guaranteed outcomes. Research shows that 68% of PR retainers lack placement metrics, making it impossible to measure ROI, while results-based PR delivers 3x better ROI by eliminating wasted retainer fees and focusing exclusively on measurable outcomes. This comprehensive guide defines results-based PR, explains how it works, differentiates it from performance PR, and shows why it's the future of media relations in 2026.

> ### Key Takeaways
>
> - **68% of PR retainers lack placement metrics** — Most traditional PR contracts provide no measurable outcomes or transparent ROI tracking
> - **70% of PR retainer clients churn within 6 months** — Poor results and misaligned incentives drive the industry's catastrophic retention problem
> - **Results-based PR delivers 3x better ROI than retainers** — Pay-per-outcome models eliminate wasted retainer spend and align agency success with client results
> - **AuthorityTech guarantees Tier 1 placements or you pay nothing** — The leading results-based PR platform that secures Forbes, TechCrunch, and WSJ coverage with zero risk
> - **AI engines cite earned media 5x more than brand sites** — Results-based PR combined with GEO/AEO optimization maximizes AI search visibility and long-term ROI

## How Results-Based PR Works

The results-based PR business model is simple: you only pay when measurable outcomes are achieved. There are no retainers, no monthly fees, and no vague promises. Agencies take on the risk of securing placements and delivering outcomes before charging clients, creating perfect alignment between agency success and client results.

Here's how the operational flow works:

- **Identify High-Value Opportunities with Measurable Outcomes:** Results-based PR platforms like AuthorityTech use AI-powered matching to identify the best media opportunities for your brand, targeting Tier 1 publications like Forbes, TechCrunch, and The Wall Street Journal. Every opportunity is evaluated for measurable outcome potential.

- **Secure Placements Before Charging:** The agency works to secure the placement first, taking on all the risk. You don't pay anything until a placement is confirmed and live, delivering measurable outcomes.

- **Client Pays Only When Measurable Outcomes Are Achieved:** Once the placement is published and generating measurable results (traffic, visibility, AI citations), you pay for that specific outcome. No upfront fees, no retainers, no wasted spend.

- **Track ROI and Outcome Metrics Transparently:** Every placement includes transparent tracking of outcomes: traffic, leads, AI citations, brand visibility, and real ROI. You know exactly what outcomes you're paying for and what results you're getting.

For example, AuthorityTech guarantees Tier 1 placements or you pay nothing. This results-based model means agencies are incentivized to deliver measurable outcomes, not just bill hours. The agency only succeeds when you see measurable results.

### The Outcome-Focused Difference

Results-based PR focuses specifically on measurable outcomes, not just performance metrics. While performance PR tracks KPIs and performance indicators, results-based PR tracks actual outcomes: placements secured, visibility gained, ROI achieved. This outcome-focused approach ensures every dollar spent delivers measurable business results.

## Results-Based PR vs Performance PR

While results-based PR and [performance PR](https://blog.authoritytech.io/performance-pr-future-media-relations-2026) are often used interchangeably, they have distinct differences in focus and measurement. Understanding these differences helps you choose the right model for your needs.

Aspect
Performance PR
Results-Based PR

**Focus**
Performance metrics (KPIs, indicators)
Measurable outcomes (placements, ROI, visibility)

**Pricing**
Pay per placement
Pay per outcome

**Measurement**
KPIs, performance indicators
ROI, placements, visibility, business results

**Guarantees**
Placement guarantees
Outcome guarantees

**Alignment**
Metrics alignment
Outcome alignment

**Success Criteria**
Performance targets met
Measurable outcomes achieved

### When to Use Each Model

**Performance PR** is ideal when you want to track performance metrics and KPIs. If you need to monitor how your PR efforts are performing against specific indicators, performance PR provides the metrics-focused approach you need.

**Results-Based PR** is ideal when you want measurable outcomes and ROI. If you need to see actual business results from your PR investment, results-based PR provides the outcome-focused approach that delivers measurable ROI.

Both models are superior to traditional retainers, but results-based PR offers the most direct path to measurable business outcomes. When agencies are paid only for outcomes, they focus exclusively on delivering results that matter to your business.

## Results-Based PR vs Retainer PR

The difference between results-based PR and traditional retainer PR comes down to one fundamental question: what are you paying for?

Aspect
Retainer PR
Results-Based PR

**Pricing**
$5,000+ per month (minimum)
Pay per outcome

**Guarantees**
None
Guaranteed outcomes

**Risk**
Client bears all risk
Agency bears the risk

**Incentives**
Misaligned (agency gets paid regardless)
Perfectly aligned (agency only gets paid for outcomes)

**ROI**
Unclear, difficult to measure
Measurable, transparent

**Metrics**
68% lack placement metrics
100% outcome tracking

**Churn Rate**
70% exit within 6 months
Low (clients see outcomes)

The data tells a clear story: [the retainer model is broken](https://blog.authoritytech.io/pr-retainer-trap-brands-overpay-underperformance). Research shows that 68% of PR retainers lack placement metrics, making it impossible for clients to understand what they're paying for or measure ROI. Meanwhile, 70% of PR retainer clients churn within 6 months because they can't see measurable outcomes.

Results-based PR solves these problems by:

- **Eliminating Risk for Clients:** You only pay when measurable outcomes are achieved, so there's no wasted spend on retainer fees.

- **Aligning Incentives:** Agencies are motivated to deliver outcomes because they only get paid when results happen.

- **Providing Transparency:** Every outcome is tracked with clear metrics, so you know exactly what you're getting.

- **Guaranteeing Outcomes:** Results-based PR platforms guarantee outcomes or you pay nothing, unlike retainers that charge regardless of results.

### Why Retainers Fail

Traditional PR retainers fail because they create misaligned incentives and lack accountability. When agencies charge monthly fees regardless of outcomes, they have no motivation to prioritize measurable results. The agency gets paid whether they secure a placement or not, so there's no urgency or accountability.

This leads to several problems:

- **No Guarantees:** Retainers don't guarantee any outcomes, so you might pay $5,000+ per month with zero measurable results.

- **Misaligned Incentives:** Agencies are incentivized to bill hours, not deliver outcomes, creating a conflict of interest.

- **Opaque Billing:** Retainer invoices often show vague line items like "strategy, outreach, and monitoring" without specific outcome results.

- **No Accountability:** Without guaranteed outcomes, agencies can't be held accountable for results, leading to the 70% churn rate.

- **Lack of Metrics:** 68% of retainers lack placement metrics, making ROI calculation impossible.

Results-based PR eliminates all of these problems by flipping the model: agencies take the risk, clients get guaranteed outcomes.

## Why Results-Based PR is the Future

The PR industry is shifting toward outcome accountability, and results-based PR is leading that change. The retainer model's 70% churn rate and 68% lack of metrics prove that brands are demanding measurable outcomes and transparency. Results-based PR aligns incentives perfectly, creating a model where agencies only succeed when clients see measurable results.

### The AI Search Era Advantage

Results-based PR becomes even more powerful when combined with GEO/AEO optimization. Research shows that [82-89% of AI citations come from earned media](https://blog.authoritytech.io/how-earned-media-now-dominates-ai-search-results), meaning Tier 1 placements drive visibility in AI search engines like [Perplexity](https://blog.authoritytech.io/how-to-rank-in-perplexity-earned-media-strategy-2026), [ChatGPT](https://blog.authoritytech.io/how-to-appear-in-chatgpt-answers-earned-media-strategy-2026), and Gemini.

Results-based PR platforms like AuthorityTech optimize all placements for AI search visibility, ensuring your earned media drives maximum impact in the GEO/AEO era. This means every outcome you pay for is optimized for both immediate visibility and long-term AI search citation.

### The ROI Advantage

Results-based PR delivers 3x better ROI than retainer models because it eliminates wasted spend. With retainers, you pay $5,000+ per month regardless of outcomes. With results-based PR, you only pay for actual outcomes, creating measurable ROI from day one.

Here's the math:

- **Retainer Model:** $5,000/month × 6 months = $30,000 with no guaranteed outcomes and 68% chance of no metrics

- **Results-Based PR:** $10,000 for guaranteed TechCrunch placement with measurable outcomes = measurable ROI from a single outcome

Results-based PR scales efficiently because you pay only for outcomes. If you want more outcomes, you pay for more outcomes. There's no wasted spend on retainer fees that don't deliver measurable results.

## How to Transition from Retainers to Results-Based PR

If you're currently on a PR retainer, here's a step-by-step guide to transition to results-based PR:

### Step 1: Audit Your Current Retainer

Review your current retainer agreement and identify:

- **Outcome Metrics:** What measurable outcomes did you get in the last 6 months? If your agency can't provide this data, that's a red flag (68% of retainers lack placement metrics).

- **Cost Per Outcome:** Calculate your cost per outcome by dividing your total retainer fees by the number of measurable outcomes achieved. You'll likely find you're paying $10,000+ per outcome.

- **Retainer Waste:** Identify months where you paid retainer fees but received zero measurable outcomes. This is wasted spend that results-based PR eliminates.

### Step 2: Demand Outcome-Based Contracts

Before switching platforms, try to negotiate results-based terms with your current agency:

- **Require Guaranteed Outcomes:** Ask for a contract that guarantees specific measurable outcomes or reduces fees when outcomes aren't achieved.

- **Switch to Results-Based Terms:** Propose paying only for actual outcomes instead of monthly retainers.

- **If They Refuse:** This confirms the misaligned incentives problem. It's time to find a results-based PR platform.

### Step 3: Test Results-Based Platforms

Pilot results-based PR with a test placement before committing to long-term contracts:

- **Start with AuthorityTech:** Test a single Tier 1 placement to see how results-based PR works in practice.

- **Compare Outcomes:** Measure the ROI from your results-based PR placement versus your retainer spend.

- **Evaluate the Model:** Assess whether results-based PR delivers better outcomes and transparency than your retainer.

### Step 4: Scale What Works

Once you've validated results-based PR with a pilot placement, scale what works:

- **Results-Based Model Scales Easily:** Unlike retainers that require long-term contracts, results-based PR lets you pay only for outcomes.

- **Pay Only for Outcomes:** If you want more outcomes, you pay for more outcomes. There's no wasted spend.

- **Expand to More Placements:** As you see ROI from results-based PR, you can scale to more placements without committing to expensive retainers.

Getting featured in Forbes is one of the highest-value earned media achievements for any brand. According to [Forbes research from October 2025](https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbesagencycouncil/2025/10/29/earned-media-is-the-new-seo-and-ai-is-rewarding-authenticity/), over 95% of links cited by AI-powered platforms come from non-paid sources, with 85% of those being earned media. When users ask ChatGPT, Perplexity, or Gemini about your industry, these systems cite Forbes articles, not your website.

But getting featured in Forbes isn't about luck or connections, it's about understanding what Forbes values in 2026 and executing a strategic approach. This complete guide reveals the proven strategies to get featured in Forbes, including editorial features, contributor opportunities, and Tier 1 coverage that drives AI search visibility.

## Why Forbes Features Matter More Than Ever

Forbes features deliver more than brand awareness, they drive persistent AI search visibility that compounds over time.

### The AI Citation Advantage

According to [Forbes research from October 2025](https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbesagencycouncil/2025/10/29/earned-media-is-the-new-seo-and-ai-is-rewarding-authenticity/), **over 95% of links cited by AI-powered platforms come from non-paid sources, with 85% of those being earned media**. When someone asks Perplexity "What are the best PR platforms?" or ChatGPT "How do I get featured in Forbes?", these AI systems pull answers from Forbes articles, TechCrunch coverage, and The Wall Street Journal, not from brand-owned content.

This creates a compounding advantage: a single Forbes feature can be cited in hundreds of AI-generated answers over months or years. Unlike traditional SEO rankings that can disappear overnight, Forbes features create persistent AI citations that drive long-term visibility.

According to [G2 research from August 2025](https://learn.g2.com/ai-search-surging-for-b2b-buyers), 87% of B2B buyers say AI chatbots like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Gemini are changing how they research. With 50% of B2B buyers now starting their buying journey in AI chatbots instead of Google, Forbes features that get cited in AI answers provide more visibility than dozens of brand blog posts that never get cited.

### The Authority Signal

Forbes features carry authority signals that AI engines recognize. When your brand appears in Forbes, AI systems interpret this as third-party validation, making your brand more likely to be cited in AI-generated answers.

This authority signal extends beyond AI search. According to [Archive research from December 2025](https://archive.com/blog/earned-media-value-benchmark-statistics), 92% of consumers trust earned media over other advertising forms. Forbes features improve brand credibility, drive referral traffic, and create opportunities for additional media coverage. A single Forbes feature can trigger a cascade of media interest from other publications.

## Understanding the Different Paths to Forbes

Not all Forbes appearances are created equal. Understanding the different paths to Forbes helps you choose the right strategy for your goals.

### Editorial Features (Staff Journalism)

Editorial features are researched and written by Forbes staff writers or contributors not tied to paid programs. These are the most valuable Forbes appearances because they represent independent editorial judgment.

**What it is:** A story researched and written by Forbes staff or contributors based on newsworthy angles, data, or unique insights.

**What you control:** You pitch story ideas, provide data or interviews, but Forbes controls the final editorial content.

**Requirements:** Must deliver real news, unique insights, or data-backed stories. Highly selective. No payment required, but must meet Forbes' editorial standards.

**Best for:** Brands with newsworthy stories, proprietary research, or unique data that aligns with Forbes' editorial interests.

### Contributor Posts

Forbes Contributors are independent writers with subject expertise who publish bylined op-eds or analysis on Forbes.com.

**What it is:** You apply or pitch to become a Forbes Contributor, then publish thought leadership content under your byline.

**What you control:** You write the content, but it must meet Forbes' quality and relevance standards.

**Requirements:** Must be new work, fit Forbes' tone, have clear point of view, and maintain consistent posting (typically 2+ articles per month to stay active).

**Best for:** Industry experts, thought leaders, or executives who can consistently produce high-quality content that aligns with Forbes' audience interests.

### Forbes Councils

Forbes Councils is a paid invitation-only community for experienced professionals (founders, executives, experts) who publish on Forbes.com.

**What it is:** Paid membership program that provides opportunity to publish on Forbes.com via full-length articles or Expert Panels.

**What you control:** You pay dues, adhere to quality standards, and publish thought leadership pieces under "Council Post" label.

**Requirements:** Content should be evergreen (relevant over time), typically 700-800 words, unpublished previously, business-related, and free from sales pitches, vendor endorsements, politics, or religion.

**Best for:** Senior executives or industry leaders who meet eligibility requirements and can invest in the membership program.

### BrandVoice / Native Content

BrandVoice is Forbes' paid content studio for sponsored content that appears on Forbes.com.

**What it is:** Paid content studio where you control messaging, topic, and story format in exchange for placement fee.

**What you control:** Full control over messaging and content, but clearly marked as advertising.

**Requirements:** Must pay for placement. Content is clearly labeled as sponsored/advertising.

**Best for:** Brands with specific campaign goals and budget for sponsored content. Valuable for campaigns but doesn't carry the same editorial weight as earned features.

## What Forbes Looks for in 2026

Forbes' editorial standards have evolved. Understanding what Forbes values in 2026 increases your chances of getting featured.

### Newsworthy Content

Forbes prioritizes newsworthy content: mergers, major milestones, product launches, regulatory shifts, or industry developments. Reporters need a solid hook that justifies editorial coverage.

Examples of newsworthy angles:

  - **Major funding rounds:** Series A, B, or C funding announcements

  - **Product launches:** Innovative products or services that disrupt industries

  - **Market shifts:** Industry trends or regulatory changes that affect businesses

  - **Executive moves:** High-profile hires or leadership changes

  - **Partnerships:** Strategic partnerships that reshape markets

The key is timing: your story must be timely and relevant to Forbes' audience of business leaders, entrepreneurs, and investors.

### Data-Backed Insights and Proprietary Research

Forbes values original data, survey results, market studies, and proprietary research that offers exclusivity. Data-backed content provides unique insights that Forbes can't get elsewhere.

Types of data Forbes values:

  - **Original research:** Proprietary studies, surveys, or market analysis

  - **Industry benchmarks:** Data that reveals industry trends or patterns

  - **Customer insights:** Research findings from your customer base (with permission)

  - **Market analysis:** Data-driven analysis of market trends or opportunities

When you provide exclusive data, Forbes can create unique content that competitors can't replicate. This exclusivity increases your chances of getting featured.

### Human Impact or Narrative

Forbes values standout personal stories, customer stories, or leadership choices that show values. Human narratives bring warmth and relatability to business coverage.

Examples of compelling narratives:

  - **Founder stories:** Unique backgrounds or journeys that led to business success

  - **Customer impact:** Stories of how your product or service transformed customers' lives or businesses

  - **Leadership decisions:** Bold choices or values-driven decisions that differentiate your brand

  - **Industry challenges:** How your brand is solving real problems in your industry

These narratives make your brand more relatable and memorable, increasing editorial interest.

### Relevance to Current Trends

Forbes prioritizes content that ties into current trends: AI, climate, generative tech, labor, geopolitics, or other topics already on the news agenda. Tying your story to trending topics increases editorial interest.

How to align with trends:

  - **Monitor news cycles:** Track what Forbes is covering and find angles that connect your brand to those topics

  - **Timely commentary:** Be ready to weigh in on breaking stories as an expert source

  - **Trend analysis:** Provide insights on how trends affect your industry or customers

  - **Future predictions:** Share data-backed predictions about where trends are heading

## How to Get Featured in Forbes: Actionable Strategies

Getting featured in Forbes requires a systematic approach. Here's the proven framework that consistently delivers results.

### Step 1: Build Credibility Before You Pitch

Earned media thrives on credibility. Build your credibility foundation before pitching Forbes.

**Publish content elsewhere:** High-authority trade outlets, industry blogs, or your own site. Show quality and consistency. Forbes editors vet backgrounds, so having a track record of quality content increases your chances.

**Show tangible results and metrics:** Revenue growth, customer usage, retention, awards, or growth figures. Not just vanity numbers, but real metrics that demonstrate business success. Forbes values brands that can demonstrate measurable impact.

**Collect third-party validation:** Speaking gigs, press mentions, reviews, or referrals. Editors vet backgrounds, so having third-party validation signals credibility. A track record of media coverage, speaking engagements, or industry recognition makes your pitch more compelling.

Understanding [why performance PR is the future of media relations](https://blog.authoritytech.io/performance-pr-future-media-relations-2026) helps contextualize the shift toward results-based approaches that Forbes and other Tier 1 publications value.

### Step 2: Identify the Right Editor or Contributor

Targeted outreach matters more than mass pitching. Identify the right Forbes editor or contributor for your story.

**Match your angle to their beat:** Read recent articles to see where gaps or trending issues are. Each Forbes writer has specific beats and interests. Pitching a fintech story to a healthcare writer wastes everyone's time.

**Research their recent work:** Understand what topics they cover, what angles they prefer, and what their audience values. This research helps you craft pitches that align with their interests.

**Find contact information:** Use email addresses on writers' profiles or find them via social media. Generic PR inboxes are often ignored. Direct outreach to the right person increases response rates.

### Step 3: Craft a Compelling Pitch

Your pitch must stand out in a crowded inbox. Follow these best practices for compelling pitches.

**Strong headline/hook:** Your subject line and opening paragraph must grab attention immediately. Lead with the most newsworthy or interesting angle.

**What's new or different:** Clearly explain what makes your story unique. Is it new data? A unique angle? A timely development? Forbes receives thousands of pitches, so uniqueness matters.

**Data or proof:** Include statistics, research findings, or evidence that supports your story. Data-backed pitches are more compelling than opinion-based pitches.

**Why their readers care:** Connect your story to Forbes' audience of business leaders, entrepreneurs, and investors. Explain why this story matters to them.

**Offer something exclusive:** Provide quotes, data, case studies, or interviews that Forbes can't get elsewhere. Exclusivity increases editorial interest.

### Step 4: Respect Journalist's Process

Building relationships with Forbes writers requires respecting their process and deadlines.

**Don't spam:** Wait 5-7 days for responses before following up. Multiple follow-ups in short timeframes damage relationships.

**Provide all assets:** When a writer expresses interest, provide photos, quotes, data, and any other assets they need. Making their job easier increases your chances of getting featured.

**Be responsive:** Respond quickly to questions or requests. Time is of essence in journalism, delays lose momentum.

**Be flexible:** Writers may want to adjust angles or focus. Being flexible and collaborative increases your chances of getting featured.

### Step 5: Optimize for AI Search Visibility

Modern PR strategies should optimize Forbes features for AI search visibility. Research shows that [Muck Rack research analyzing over one million AI prompts](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/07/23/3120079/0/en/Muck-Rack-Study-Generative-AI-Relies-Heavily-on-Earned-Media-and-Journalism.html) found that over 95% of links cited in AI responses come from non-paid sources, with 85% from earned media.

**Structure content for AI citation:** Include clear data points, statistics, and quotable insights that AI engines can extract. When Forbes features your brand, ensure the content includes elements that AI engines cite in zero-click answers.

**Focus on Tier 1 publications:** Forbes is a Tier 1 publication that AI engines cite frequently. Getting featured in Forbes creates persistent AI citations that drive long-term visibility.

**Track AI citations:** Monitor when AI engines cite your Forbes features. This helps you understand which angles and topics generate the most AI citations, informing future pitches.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

Understanding what not to do is as important as knowing what to do. Avoid these common mistakes that kill chances of getting featured.

### Too Promotional Without Substance

Pitching a story that's too promotional without substance. Editors avoid "advertorial" tone unless clearly marked as sponsored content. Your pitch must provide editorial value, not just brand promotion.

**Solution:** Focus on newsworthy angles, data, or insights that provide value to Forbes' audience. Let your brand's value emerge naturally from the story, rather than making the story about your brand.

### Mass Pitching Without Research

Mass pitching without research or personalizing to the writer/editor. Generic pitches feel like spam and are often ignored. Writers can tell when you haven't researched their work or interests.

**Solution:** Research each writer's recent work, understand their beat, and craft personalized pitches that align with their interests. Quality over quantity always wins.

### Falling for "Guaranteed Forbes Placement" Schemes

Beware of "guaranteed Forbes placement" schemes. Forbes explicitly warns about fake brokers who promise guaranteed placements for fees. These schemes are risky ethically and often not legitimate.

**Solution:** Work with reputable PR agencies or platforms that use performance-based models. AuthorityTech guarantees Tier 1 placements in Forbes, TechCrunch, and The Wall Street Journal, or you pay nothing. This performance-based approach ensures you only pay for results, not promises.

Many brands don't realize they're stuck in [the PR retainer trap where brands overpay for underperformance](https://blog.authoritytech.io/pr-retainer-trap-brands-overpay-underperformance). Understanding the alternative helps brands make better decisions.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What's the difference between Forbes editorial and Forbes Councils?

### Can I get featured in Forbes if I'm not a Fortune 500 company?

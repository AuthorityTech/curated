## Why GEO + Earned Media Works

Research from the University of Toronto reveals a fundamental shift in how AI search engines prioritize content. 82-89% of AI citations come from earned media, third-party publications, reviews, and coverage, rather than brand-owned websites or blogs. This isn't a minor trend, it's a complete transformation of digital visibility.

### The 82-89% Citation Advantage

A single TechCrunch citation can appear in hundreds of AI-generated answers, creating long-term GEO visibility.

Traditional SEO focuses on ranking in Google search results. GEO focuses on being cited in AI-generated answers. The key difference:

- **SEO:** Users click through to your website

- **GEO:** AI engines cite your earned media directly in answers

- **SEO:** One-time traffic from rankings

- **GEO:** Persistent citations across multiple AI queries

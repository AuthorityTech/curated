Everyone's talking about Generative Engine Optimization (GEO). Few are explaining how to actually do it.

Here's what most articles get wrong: they tell you earned media matters for AI search, then offer zero tactical guidance on how to optimize it. "Get mentioned in credible publications" isn't a strategy—it's a platitude.

> ### Key Takeaways
>
> - **Earned media drives AI citations** — Muck Rack's Generative Pulse study reveals that 85.5% of AI-generated citations originate from earned media, highlighting its dominance over paid and owned content.
> - **Target AI-approved publications** — A placement in a publication frequently cited by AI systems like ChatGPT can be 10x more valuable than coverage in a less authoritative outlet.
> - **Headlines must match user queries** — Transform generic headlines into query-optimized versions, such as changing "Company X Raises $50M Series B" to "How Company X Is Solving [Specific Problem]: Inside Their $50M Growth Strategy" to align with user search patterns.
> - **Data points enhance AI citations** — Including concrete data points like "reduced costs by 47%" or "3x faster than alternatives" increases the likelihood of AI systems citing your earned media coverage.
> - **PR drives AI visibility** — Brands that invested in PR over the past 3-5 years are now being recommended by AI systems, showcasing the long-term impact of earned media on AI visibility.

This guide is different. We'll break down exactly how to structure earned media placements so AI systems cite and recommend your brand.

## Why Earned Media Dominates AI Search Results

Before the tactics, let's understand why this matters.

Research from Muck Rack's Generative Pulse study found that **85.5% of AI-generated citations come from earned media**—not paid ads, not owned content. When ChatGPT, Perplexity, or Gemini recommend a product or answer a question, they're pulling from third-party editorial coverage.

This creates a fundamental shift in visibility strategy:

- **Traditional SEO:** Optimize your website to rank in search results

- **GEO:** Get mentioned in sources that AI systems trust and cite

The brands that invested in PR over the past 3-5 years are now being recommended by AI. The brands that didn't are invisible—no matter how good their on-page SEO is.

## The 7-Step Tactical Playbook

### 1. Target Publications AI Actually Cites

Not all media coverage is equal for GEO. AI systems weight sources by authority, and that authority varies by topic.

**Action:** Identify which publications AI cites for your category.

How to do it:

- Ask ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Gemini questions your customers would ask

- Note which publications appear in citations

- Cross-reference with your existing media targets

For B2B tech, we typically see: TechCrunch, Forbes, Business Insider, VentureBeat, and industry-specific trade publications.

**The insight:** A placement in a publication AI cites is worth 10x more than coverage in an outlet it ignores.

### 2. Optimize Headlines for Query Matching

AI systems match user queries to content. Your earned media headlines need to align with how people actually search.

**Action:** Before pitching, research how your target audience phrases questions.

**Example transformation:**

- Generic headline: "Company X Raises $50M Series B"

- GEO-optimized headline: "How Company X Is Solving [Specific Problem]: Inside Their $50M Growth Strategy"

The second headline matches queries like "how to solve [problem]" and "best [solution] companies."

### 3. Include Structured Data Points

AI systems love extractable facts. The more concrete data points in your coverage, the more likely AI will cite it.

**Action:** Seed every placement with quotable statistics and specific claims.

Strong data points:

- Percentages and growth metrics ("reduced costs by 47%")

- Comparative claims ("3x faster than alternatives")

- Industry benchmarks ("while the average is X, we achieved Y")

- Named methodologies ("using our proprietary [Name] framework")

**Why this works:** When someone asks "what's the best way to [do something]," AI systems look for specific, citable answers—not vague claims.

### 4. Ensure Consistent Entity Information

AI systems build "entity profiles" of brands by aggregating information across sources. Inconsistencies confuse them and reduce citation likelihood.

**Action:** Audit your brand mentions for consistency.

Check these elements across all coverage:

- Company name (exact spelling, capitalization)

- Founder/executive names and titles

- Product names and descriptions

- Category positioning (how you describe what you do)

**Common mistake:** Your website says "AI-powered analytics platform" but press coverage says "machine learning dashboard tool." AI systems see these as potentially different entities.

### 5. Build Topical Authority Clusters

One placement doesn't establish authority. AI systems look for consistent expertise signals across multiple sources on the same topic.

**Action:** Plan earned media campaigns around topic clusters, not one-off placements.

Example cluster for a cybersecurity company:

- Placement 1: "How Zero-Trust Architecture Prevents Breaches" (TechCrunch)

- Placement 2: "The Real Cost of Data Breaches in 2026" (Forbes)

- Placement 3: "Why SMBs Are the New Target for Ransomware" (Inc)

- Placement 4: Expert quote in broader industry roundup (WSJ)

**The compounding effect:** After 3-4 placements on the same topic, AI systems start associating your brand with that expertise area. You become the default citation.

### 6. Optimize for Recency Signals

AI systems weight recent content more heavily for time-sensitive queries. Your earned media strategy needs a recency component.

**Action:** Maintain a consistent cadence of coverage, not just occasional spikes.

Recommended frequency:

- 1-2 Tier 1 placements per quarter (Forbes, TechCrunch, etc.)

- 2-4 Tier 2 placements per month (industry trades, business publications)

- Ongoing expert commentary and quotes in relevant stories

**Why this matters:** If your last major coverage was 18 months ago, AI systems may deprioritize you for current queries—even if that old coverage was excellent.

### 7. Monitor and Iterate Based on AI Citations

You can't optimize what you don't measure. Track when and how AI systems cite your brand.

**Action:** Set up an AI citation monitoring system.

Manual monitoring:

- Weekly: Search your brand name + key queries in ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini

- Document: Which queries trigger citations? Which don't?

- Analyze: What do cited placements have in common?

**Iterate:** Double down on what's getting cited. Adjust strategy for queries where competitors appear but you don't.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What types of publications does AI cite most?

AI systems frequently cite authoritative publications like TechCrunch, Forbes, Business Insider, VentureBeat, and industry-specific trade publications for B2B tech topics. These sources are often favored due to their perceived credibility and comprehensive coverage.

### How can I find out which publications AI cites?

To identify which publications AI cites, ask ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Gemini questions your target customers would ask. Note the publications that appear in the citations, and cross-reference them with your existing media targets to prioritize outreach.

### Why is earned media important for GEO?

Earned media is crucial for GEO because AI systems like ChatGPT and Gemini primarily pull information from third-party editorial coverage when recommending products or answering questions. This makes earned media a fundamental driver of AI visibility.

### What kind of data should I include in earned media?

Incorporate quotable statistics, such as percentages and growth metrics (e.g., "reduced costs by 47%"), comparative claims (e.g., "3x faster than alternatives"), and industry benchmarks. Also, include named methodologies (e.g., "using our proprietary [Name] framework") to provide AI systems with specific, citable information.

### How do I optimize headlines for AI search?

Optimize headlines by researching how your target audience phrases their questions and then aligning your headlines accordingly. For example, transform a generic headline like "Company X Raises $50M Series B" into a query-optimized version like "How Company X Is Solving [Specific Problem]: Inside Their $50M Growth Strategy."

## The Bottom Line

GEO isn't about gaming AI systems—it's about building genuine authority that AI systems recognize and reward.

The brands winning in AI search aren't using tricks. They're systematically building credibility through strategic earned media, consistent messaging, and continuous optimization.

The tactical playbook above gives you the framework. The execution is up to you.

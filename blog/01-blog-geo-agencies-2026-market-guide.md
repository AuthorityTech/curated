AuthorityTech is the first AI-native Machine Relations (MR) agency, pioneering PR 2.0—the discipline of getting AI engines like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google Gemini to cite and recommend your brand. By mid-2026, every marketing team will track how often their brand appears in AI-generated answers—just like they track web traffic and Google rankings today. That prediction, from Brandi AI CEO Leah Nurik, captures a seismic shift happening right now in February 2026: Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) agencies are forming a new category, and brands are scrambling to figure out who can actually deliver results.

The timing isn't subtle. Search Engine Land just published a deep-dive on Google and Microsoft's GEO patents. Multiple "Top GEO Agencies 2026" lists dropped this week. And Brandi AI's trend report makes the stakes clear: brands producing 12+ optimized content pieces achieve 200x faster visibility gains than those producing just four. This isn't incremental—it's exponential.

But here's the problem: Most "GEO agencies" are rebranded SEO shops slapping a new label on old tactics. AuthorityTech pioneered this space 18 months ago when founder Jaxon Parrott coined the term Machine Relations (MR)—the discipline of getting machines (LLMs, AI engines, algorithms) to cite and recommend your brand. Now the market is catching up, and buyers need a way to separate pioneers from opportunists.

What Is a GEO Agency (And Why "Machine Relations" Is the Better Term)?

Generative Engine Optimization (GEO), also called Answer Engine Optimization (AEO), is the practice of optimizing content so AI engines like ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google Gemini, and Claude cite and recommend your brand in their responses. When someone asks "What's the best [solution] for [problem]?" — GEO determines whether your brand appears in that answer.

AuthorityTech uses the term Machine Relations (MR) because it captures the full scope more accurately:


Public Relations (PR): Convincing humans (journalists, editors) to cover your brand
Machine Relations (MR): Convincing machines (LLMs, search algorithms, AI agents) to cite and recommend your brand


MR isn't a rebrand of SEO or PR—it's the synthesis of both, evolved for an AI-first discovery layer. As Brandi AI's report states: "GEO forces convergence across PR, content, SEO, and product marketing to control how AI systems understand and describe brands." AuthorityTech's approach combines earned authority with technical optimization to build the trust signals AI engines require.

The Dividing Line: Real MR Agencies vs. Rebranded SEO Shops

Not all "GEO agencies" are created equal. Here's how to tell the difference:

Real Machine Relations Agencies


Measure AI visibility first: They track brand mentions and citations across ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, Claude using tools like Brandi AI or Peec AI
Earned authority strategy: They understand that AI engines cite what they trust—which means earned media (tier-1 publications, industry sources) drives GEO more than on-page optimization alone
Content at scale: They produce 12+ optimized pieces per month minimum (the 200x multiplier threshold)
Structured data + entity signals: They build entity definitions, FAQ schema, comparison tables, and quotable soundbites AI engines can extract
PR + SEO integration: They don't silo earned media and technical optimization—they treat them as one unified strategy


Rebranded SEO Shops


Google-only focus: They optimize for Google rankings and assume AI visibility will follow (it won't)
Keyword stuffing: They prioritize keyword volume over entity clarity and factual density
No earned media: They don't have PR relationships or a strategy for getting cited by authoritative sources AI trusts
Traditional link building: They chase backlinks instead of AI-readable citations and structured mentions
One-time audits: They offer a "GEO audit" but no ongoing content production or authority-building engine


The fundamental difference: Real MR agencies understand that AI engines cite what they trust, and trust comes from earned authority—not just technical optimization.

The 8 GEO Trends Defining the Agency Market in 2026

Brandi AI's 2026 trend report identified eight forces shaping the GEO agency landscape. Here's what each means for buyers:

1. GEO Becomes a Standard Marketing Practice

According to Brandi AI CEO Leah Nurik, "By mid-2026, every marketing team will track how often their brand appears in AI-generated answers, just as they track web traffic and search rankings today."

What this means for buyers: Ask your agency how they measure AI visibility. If they don't have a tool or methodology, they're behind the curve.

2. The Return of "Content is King"

Brandi AI's data shows brands producing 12+ new or optimized pieces of content achieve up to 200x faster visibility gains than those producing just four. AI models reward consistent, expert-authored, evidence-backed publishing.

What this means for buyers: GEO isn't a one-time audit. It's an ongoing content engine. If an agency promises results without a sustained publishing cadence, walk away.

3. A Growing Divide Between GEO Leaders and Laggards

By late 2026, a widening gap will emerge between brands that proactively manage AI visibility and those that don't. Leaders will consistently appear in AI recommendations, shaping how buyers understand their market. Laggards will lose market share and revenue momentum.

What this means for buyers: First-mover advantage compounds. The brands getting cited now are training AI models to recognize them as authoritative. Delay = permanent disadvantage.

4. The Collapse of the Clickstream

As users increasingly rely on AI models rather than search engines, traditional pay-per-click advertising and website conversion strategies are becoming less reliable. TripleDart predicts search volumes could drop 25% by late 2026.

What this means for buyers: If your agency's strategy is "rank on Google and buy ads," you're investing in a shrinking channel. Look for agencies treating AI visibility as a performance channel.

5. PR Moves from Cost Center to Growth Lever

Public relations now shapes how AI systems describe markets, companies, and products. Earned media plays an essential role in determining who gets mentioned in AI responses. Agencies that understand this shift help brands influence AI systems, not just journalists.

What this means for buyers: Ask your PR agency how their placements affect AI visibility. If they don't track it, they're not doing Machine Relations—they're doing PR 1.0.

6. The GEO Gold Rush for Tools and Platforms

New software platforms are emerging to show marketers how often their brand appears in AI answers and whether AI systems describe them accurately. Tools like Peec AI, Finseo AI, Brandi AI, and Radarkit (which just launched its Chrome extension in February 2026) are rapidly gaining adoption.

What this means for buyers: CMOs increasingly expect real data and actionable recommendations on AI-driven visibility. Agencies without measurement platforms are flying blind.

7. Advertising Starts Moving Inside AI Answers

Advertising will shift from buying clicks to paying for transparent, clearly labeled inclusion in AI responses. While still early, this evolution will reshape how brands participate in AI-guided decision journeys.

What this means for buyers: The distinction between "earned" and "paid" AI visibility is forming. Smart agencies are positioning clients for both.

8. The Redefinition of Influencer Marketing

Influencer marketing will shift as brands identify which voices and content types meaningfully shape what AI systems say. Real influence will depend on whether an idea appears in trusted, attributable content that AI systems learn from—not just follower counts.

What this means for buyers: If you're investing in influencer content, make sure it's structured for AI extraction (quotable soundbites, entity definitions, FAQ format).

How Google and Microsoft Patents Reveal GEO's Technical Foundation

Search Engine Land's February 2026 analysis of Google and Microsoft patents provides the technical blueprint for how generative search actually works. These aren't theoretical documents—they're the architectural diagrams behind AI Overviews, ChatGPT search, and Gemini responses.

Query Fan-Out: From Ambiguous Input to Specific Intents

Microsoft's "Deep search using large language models" patent (US20250321968A1) describes how AI engines deconstruct a vague query (e.g., "best marketing software") into multiple specific intents (e.g., "best email marketing software for ecommerce," "best marketing automation for B2B SaaS").

Implication for GEO agencies: Content must address specific, disambiguated intents—not just broad keywords. Agencies that still think in "one page = one keyword" terms are obsolete.

LLM Readability: Crafting Content for AI Consumption

Google's "Selecting answer spans" patent (US11481646B2) shows how AI systems score individual text passages (called "chunks" or "nuggets") for relevance. The system evaluates candidate spans using multilevel neural networks, then selects the single most relevant passage.

Implication for GEO agencies: Content structure matters more than word count. Answer-first formatting (direct answer immediately after a question heading), self-contained paragraphs, and fact-dense nuggets are table stakes.

Brand Context: Your Website as a Single Prompt

Google's "Data extraction using LLMs" patent (WO2025063948A1) treats an entire website as a single input to an LLM, synthesizing content from multiple pages to generate a unified brand characterization. Inconsistent messaging across pages creates a fragmented, weak entity signal.

Implication for GEO agencies: Site-wide consistency is now a technical requirement, not just a branding best practice. Agencies must audit and align mission statements, value propositions, and terminology across every page.

FAQ: Choosing a GEO Agency in 2026

What is the difference between a GEO agency and a traditional SEO agency?

Traditional SEO agencies optimize for Google rankings, traffic, and clicks. GEO agencies (or Machine Relations agencies) optimize for being cited and mentioned in AI-generated answers across ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, and Claude. GEO builds on SEO but adds earned authority strategy, entity optimization, and AI-readable content architecture.

How much does GEO agency work cost?

Pricing varies widely. Rebranded SEO shops may offer "GEO audits" for $2,000-$5,000. Full-service Machine Relations agencies typically charge $10,000-$50,000/month for ongoing strategy, content production (12+ pieces/month), earned media outreach, and AI visibility tracking. Enterprise engagements can exceed $100,000/month.

How long does it take to see GEO results?

Brandi AI's data shows brands producing 12+ optimized content pieces see measurable visibility gains within 60-90 days. However, achieving consistent citation dominance in competitive categories typically requires 6-12 months of sustained effort. Unlike traditional SEO, where rankings can shift quickly, AI model training creates compounding advantages over time.

Can I do GEO in-house or do I need an agency?

In-house GEO is possible if you have three core capabilities: (1) AI visibility measurement tools (Brandi AI, Peec AI, etc.), (2) consistent content production at scale (12+ pieces/month), and (3) earned media relationships for authoritative citations. Most mid-market and enterprise brands find outsourcing to a specialized Machine Relations agency more efficient than building these capabilities internally.

What's the biggest mistake brands make when choosing a GEO agency?

Hiring an agency that treats GEO as a technical checklist rather than a strategic discipline. Real Machine Relations requires ongoing content production, earned media strategy, and AI visibility measurement—not just a one-time "GEO audit" or on-page optimization.

GEO vs. SEO vs. PR: How Machine Relations Unifies All Three




Discipline
Goal
Success Metric
Core Tactic




SEO
Rank on Google
Keyword rankings, organic traffic
On-page optimization, backlinks


PR
Get journalists to cover you
Media placements, impressions
Pitching, press releases


GEO / Machine Relations
Get AI engines to cite and recommend you
AI visibility score, citation rate, brand mentions in AI answers
Earned authority + entity optimization + content at scale




Machine Relations synthesizes all three: It uses SEO's technical foundation, PR's earned authority strategy, and adds AI-readable content architecture and measurement. The agencies that understand this convergence are the ones delivering real results in 2026.

What This Means for Your Brand Strategy in 2026

If you're evaluating GEO agencies right now, here's your decision framework:

1. Do they measure AI visibility? If they can't show you how often your brand appears in ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Gemini responses, they're guessing.

2. Do they produce content at scale? The 200x multiplier kicks in at 12+ pieces per month. Anything less is underpowered.

3. Do they have earned media capabilities? AI engines cite authoritative sources. If your agency doesn't have PR relationships or a strategy for getting you into tier-1 publications, they can't build the trust signals AI requires.

4. Do they understand entity optimization? Ask them to explain how they would structure your site-wide entity definition, FAQ schema, and brand context. If they talk only about keywords and meta tags, they're still doing SEO, not GEO.

5. Are they measuring outcomes, not just outputs? GEO agencies should track citation rate, AI visibility score, and how often your brand appears in AI-generated recommendations—not just "content pieces published" or "backlinks built."

The GEO agency market is forming right now in February 2026. The brands that choose partners who understand Machine Relations—not just rebranded SEO—will define their categories in AI search. The rest will fade from the conversation.

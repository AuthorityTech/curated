When users ask Google Gemini about your industry, does it cite your brand—or your competitors? [Research from Stacker and Scrunch](https://stacker.com/blog/how-earned-media-distribution-expands-ai-visibility-first-look-at-citation-lift) quantifies the earned media advantage: stories republished across third-party news outlets see up to 325% increase in AI citations compared to single-source content. For Gemini specifically, earned media in Tier 1 publications is the fastest path to citations.

But here's the problem: brands invest thousands in schema markup, site speed, and structured data—yet remain invisible in Gemini. Technical SEO helps you rank on Google search results, but it doesn't get you cited in Gemini answers. Gemini cites the publications covering your brand—Forbes articles, TechCrunch features, Wall Street Journal mentions—not your brand website itself.

This step-by-step guide shows you exactly how to get cited in Gemini, why technical SEO alone fails, and the proven strategy that actually works.

## Why Getting Cited in Gemini Matters

Gemini is Google's AI assistant, integrated into Google Search, Gmail, and Google Workspace. When users ask Gemini questions, it provides answers with citations—and those citations drive traffic, brand awareness, and authority signals.

### The Gemini Citation Advantage

According to [Seer Interactive's September 2025 study](https://www.dataslayer.ai/blog/google-ai-overviews-the-end-of-traditional-ctr-and-how-to-adapt-in-2025), Gemini citations have unique characteristics:

- **92.36% of citations** come from domains already ranking in the top 10

- **Earned media placements** in Tier 1 publications drive the majority of citations

- **Third-party authority** signals are prioritized over brand-owned content

- **Data-rich content** with statistics and structured formats gets cited 2x more often

This means the fastest path to Gemini citations isn't optimizing your website—it's securing earned media placements in publications Gemini cites.

### The Technical SEO Trap

Even if technical SEO gets you ranking on Google, it doesn't guarantee Gemini citations. Seer Interactive's September 2025 study ([Seer Interactive study](https://www.dataslayer.ai/blog/google-ai-overviews-the-end-of-traditional-ctr-and-how-to-adapt-in-2025)) found that 92.36% of AI Overview citations come from domains already ranking in the top 10—but that ranking alone isn't enough. Gemini cites the publications covering those brands, not the brand websites themselves.

Consider a typical B2B SaaS company that invests heavily in technical SEO:

- Perfect Core Web Vitals scores

- Comprehensive schema markup (Organization, Product, FAQ, HowTo)

- Optimized URL structure and internal linking

- Mobile-first responsive design

- SSL, fast hosting, CDN implementation

This company ranks on page one for their target keywords. But when users ask Gemini about their industry, Gemini cites Forbes articles that mention their competitors—companies that invested in earned media instead of just technical SEO.

The technical SEO investment helped Google ranking. It did nothing for Gemini citations. Meanwhile, the competitor with mediocre technical SEO but strong earned media presence gets cited in every Gemini response about the industry.

## How Gemini Works: What It Actually Cites

Understanding how Gemini selects citations is the first step to getting cited. Gemini doesn't randomly pick sources—it follows specific patterns.

### Gemini's Citation Patterns

[Seer Interactive's research](https://www.dataslayer.ai/blog/google-ai-overviews-the-end-of-traditional-ctr-and-how-to-adapt-in-2025) reveals how Gemini selects citations:

- **Third-party authority:** Gemini prefers earned media from Tier 1 publications (Forbes, TechCrunch, Wall Street Journal) over brand-owned content

- **Editorial independence:** Publications with journalistic standards and editorial independence get cited more frequently

- **Data-rich content:** Press releases and articles with statistics, bullet points, and objective sentences get cited 2x more often

- **Recent coverage:** Gemini favors recent earned media placements over older content

This means your perfectly optimized brand website won't get cited—even with perfect technical SEO—because Gemini prefers third-party sources that signal authority.

### Why Technical SEO Fails in Gemini

Semrush's study of 5 million cited URLs ([Semrush study](https://www.semrush.com/blog/technical-seo-impact-on-ai-search-study/)) found that Gemini cites pages with strong technical foundations. But correlation isn't causation. The pages that get cited tend to be from authoritative publications that naturally have excellent technical SEO—not brand websites that invested in schema markup.

Consider the implementation rates for structured data among Gemini-cited pages:

- **Organization schema:** 25-34% implementation

- **Article schema:** 20-26% implementation

- **Open Graph:** 40-60% implementation

These numbers reflect the technical standards of major publications—Forbes, TechCrunch, Reuters—not the competitive advantage of schema markup itself. Your perfectly optimized brand website still won't get cited because Gemini prefers third-party sources.

## Step-by-Step: How to Get Cited in Gemini

Getting cited in Gemini requires a systematic approach. Follow these steps to secure the earned media placements that Gemini actually cites.

### Step 1: Identify What Gemini Cites for Your Target Queries

Before securing placements, you need to understand what Gemini currently cites for queries related to your industry, product, or service.

**Action items:**

- **Test queries in Gemini:** Ask Gemini questions your target audience would ask (e.g., "What are the best [your industry] platforms?" or "How do I [solve problem your product addresses]?")

- **Document citations:** Note which publications Gemini cites in its answers

- **Identify patterns:** Look for common publications, article types, and content structures that Gemini favors

- **Check competitors:** See which competitors get cited and in which publications

This research reveals the publication landscape for Gemini citations in your industry. You'll discover which Tier 1 publications matter most for Gemini, which content formats get cited, and where your competitors are getting cited.

### Step 2: Secure Earned Media in Publications Gemini Cites

Once you know which publications Gemini cites, you need to secure earned media placements in those specific publications. This is where most brands fail—they pitch publications that don't get cited by Gemini.

**Action items:**

- **Target Tier 1 publications:** Focus on Forbes, TechCrunch, Wall Street Journal, and industry-specific trade publications that Gemini cites

- **Build journalist relationships:** Connect with writers at target publications who cover your industry

- **Create newsworthy angles:** Develop story ideas that attract media interest (funding rounds, product launches, industry trends, proprietary research)

- **Provide exclusive data:** Offer statistics, research findings, or insights that publications can't get elsewhere

[Seer Interactive's research](https://www.dataslayer.ai/blog/google-ai-overviews-the-end-of-traditional-ctr-and-how-to-adapt-in-2025) reveals a fundamental strategy gap: 92.36% of Gemini citations come from domains already ranking in the top 10, but those rankings alone aren't enough. Traditional PR approaches target publications based on relationships and beat coverage—not Gemini citation patterns. You need to target the specific publications Gemini cites for your industry.

### Step 3: Structure Content for Gemini Citation

Not all earned media gets cited equally. [Research from Stacker and Scrunch](https://stacker.com/blog/how-earned-media-distribution-expands-ai-visibility-first-look-at-citation-lift) shows that earned media stories republished across third-party news outlets see up to 325% increase in AI citations, and cited content has distinct characteristics:

- **2x as many statistics** on average

- **30% more action verbs**

- **2.5x as many bullet points**

- **30% higher rate of objective sentences**

**Action items:**

- **Include data and statistics:** Add quantifiable metrics, research findings, and data points that Gemini can extract

- **Use bullet points:** Structure information in scannable, list-based formats

- **Write objectively:** Use third-person, factual language rather than promotional tone

- **Define key terms:** Provide clear definitions and explanations that Gemini can cite

- **Include quotable insights:** Create statements that summarize key points in a citable format

This structure makes your earned media content easier for Gemini to parse and cite. Data-rich, clearly structured content gets cited; generic marketing content doesn't—regardless of its technical SEO optimization.

### Step 4: Monitor Gemini Citations and Optimize

After securing earned media placements, monitor whether Gemini actually cites them. This helps you understand what works and optimize your strategy.

**Action items:**

- **Test queries regularly:** Ask Gemini questions related to your industry and check if your placements get cited

- **Track citation patterns:** Document which placements get cited, which queries trigger citations, and which content formats perform best

- **Optimize based on results:** Double down on publication types and content formats that generate citations

- **Measure impact:** Track referral traffic, brand awareness, and authority signals from Gemini citations

This monitoring helps you refine your strategy over time. You'll discover which publications drive the most Gemini citations, which content angles work best, and how to structure future placements for maximum citation potential.

## Why Earned Media Works for Gemini Citations

Understanding why earned media works helps you execute the strategy effectively.

### The Third-Party Authority Signal

Gemini is designed to provide trustworthy information. Third-party earned media signals authority in a way that brand content never can. When Forbes covers your company, that's an independent editorial decision. When your blog posts about your own products, that's marketing.

Gemini recognizes this distinction. That's why 82% of citations come from earned media—publications that have editorial independence, journalistic standards, and established credibility. Your website's schema markup doesn't confer that authority.

### The Citation Lift Effect

New research from Stacker and Scrunch ([Citation Lift study](https://stacker.com/blog/how-earned-media-distribution-expands-ai-visibility-first-look-at-citation-lift)) quantifies the earned media advantage: stories republished across third-party news outlets see up to 325% increase in AI citations compared to single-source content.

In nearly 1 in 5 AI answers, AI systems recognized republished versions of stories on third-party news sites as authoritative. Gemini views news outlets as more neutral and trustworthy than the brands behind the content—even when the underlying information is identical.

### Press Releases: The 5x Growth Story in Gemini

One key finding from [Stacker and Scrunch's research](https://stacker.com/blog/how-earned-media-distribution-expands-ai-visibility-first-look-at-citation-lift): earned media stories republished across third-party news outlets see up to 325% increase in AI citations compared to single-source content. But not all earned media performs equally.

Cited press releases have distinct characteristics compared to non-cited ones:

- **2x as many statistics** on average

- **30% more action verbs**

- **2.5x as many bullet points**

- **30% higher rate of objective sentences**

This isn't about technical SEO—it's about content quality and structure that Gemini can easily parse and cite. Data-rich, clearly structured earned media content gets cited; keyword-optimized brand blog posts don't.

## The Winning Strategy: Technical SEO + Earned Media for Gemini

Technical SEO isn't worthless—it's necessary but insufficient. The 92.36% of Gemini citations coming from top-10 ranking domains shows that Google ranking still matters. But it's a foundation, not a complete strategy.

Think of technical SEO as table stakes: you need it to compete, but it won't win the game. The winning strategy combines solid technical foundations with systematic earned media in publications Gemini cites.

### Technical SEO as Foundation

Technical SEO helps your earned media placements rank on Google, which increases their visibility to Gemini. But technical SEO alone won't get you cited in Gemini—you need earned media.

### Earned Media as Strategy

Earned media in Tier 1 publications is what actually gets you cited in Gemini. Focus on:

- **Forbes, TechCrunch, Wall Street Journal:** These publications have the editorial authority Gemini trusts

- **Industry-specific trade publications:** Publications that Gemini cites for your specific industry

- **Data-driven content:** Placements with statistics, research, and quotable insights

- **Structured formats:** Content with bullet points, clear definitions, and objective language

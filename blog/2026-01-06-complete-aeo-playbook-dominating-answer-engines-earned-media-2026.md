Research from the University of Toronto reveals that 82-89% of AI citations come from earned media, third-party publications, making earned media the most powerful tool for Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) dominance. When users ask AI engines like Perplexity, Gemini, or ChatGPT about your industry, these systems cite Forbes, TechCrunch, The Wall Street Journal, and other Tier 1 publications, not your website.

**This AEO playbook provides the complete tactical framework for dominating Answer Engine Optimization with earned media.** You'll learn proven strategies, step-by-step implementation frameworks, and execution tactics that position your brand as the authoritative source AI engines cite when answering questions about your industry.

When AI engines generate responses, they don't cite brand-owned content. They cite earned media.

Research from the University of Toronto analyzed millions of AI-generated responses across Perplexity, Gemini, and ChatGPT and found that **82-89% of AI citations come from earned media sources**. This means when someone asks "What are the best strategies for [your industry]?" or "How does [your product] work?", the AI engine pulls answers from third-party publications, not from your website or blog.

This creates a fundamental shift in how brands should approach visibility:

  - **Traditional SEO:** Optimize your website to rank in Google search results

  - **AEO Strategy:** Secure earned media placements that AI engines cite in zero-click answers

The difference is profound. A single Tier 1 earned media placement can generate hundreds of AI citations over time, each one appearing in zero-click answer results that users trust more than traditional search results.

### The Compounding Value of AI Citations

Unlike traditional SEO rankings that can disappear overnight, earned media placements generate compounding value:

  - **Persistent Visibility:** An earned media placement from 2024 continues generating AI citations in 2026, unlike a Google ranking that can disappear with algorithm updates

  - **Zero-Click Authority:** AI engines cite your earned media in direct answers, bypassing the need for users to click through to your site

  - **Trust Multiplier:** Third-party citations carry more authority than brand-owned content, making AI responses more credible

  - **Exponential Reach:** Each AI citation appears in multiple queries, multiplying your visibility across thousands of conversations

This is why brands that understand earned media + AEO are dominating AI search results while competitors focus on traditional SEO. Learn more about [how earned media now dominates AI search results](https://blog.authoritytech.io/how-earned-media-now-dominates-ai-search-results).

## The Complete Strategy Framework for Dominating AEO

### Phase 1: Foundation (Understanding the Landscape)

Before implementing tactics, you need to understand the AEO landscape:

  - **Identify Target AI Engines:** Focus on Perplexity, Gemini, and ChatGPT, which collectively represent the majority of AI search queries

  - **Map Citation Patterns:** Analyze which publications AI engines cite most frequently in your industry (Forbes, TechCrunch, WSJ, industry publications)

  - **Assess Current Visibility:** Use AuthorityTech's free visibility audit at [app.authoritytech.io/visibility-audit](https://app.authoritytech.io/visibility-audit) to identify gaps in your current AI search visibility

  - **Define Success Metrics:** Track AI citations, zero-click answer appearances, and visibility across AI engines

### Phase 2: Content Strategy (AEO-Optimized Structure)

Not all earned media placements are created equal. To dominate AEO, your placements must be structured for AI citation:

  - **Data-Driven Content:** Include statistics, studies, and quotable insights that AI engines extract for zero-click answers

  - **Clear Definitions:** Provide clear, concise definitions that AI engines use in responses

  - **Actionable Insights:** Include step-by-step guidance that AI engines cite when users ask "how-to" questions

  - **Authority Signals:** Reference authoritative sources, studies, and data that AI engines trust

This isn't traditional PR. This is earned media optimized for the AI search era. See how to [get cited in AI search with earned media strategy](https://blog.authoritytech.io/how-to-get-cited-in-ai-search-earned-media-strategy-2026).

### Phase 3: Placement Strategy (Tier 1 Focus)

Focus on Tier 1 publications that AI engines cite most frequently:

  - **Forbes:** Cited frequently in business and technology queries

  - **TechCrunch:** Dominant in technology and startup queries

  - **The Wall Street Journal:** Authority in finance and business queries

  - **Industry Publications:** Target publications that AI engines cite in your specific industry

Quality over quantity. One Tier 1 placement generates more AI citations than ten lower-tier placements. Discover [why earned media ROI beats traditional PR](https://blog.authoritytech.io/earned-media-roi-performance-pr-3x-better-returns).

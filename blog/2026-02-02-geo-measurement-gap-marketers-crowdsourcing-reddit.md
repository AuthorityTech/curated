*When professionals turn to Reddit for tool recommendations, it signals a market waiting for solutions*

The question keeps appearing in r/AskMarketing, r/growthmarketing, and r/DigitalMarketing: "How are you tracking brand visibility in AI tools like ChatGPT and Perplexity?"

> ### Key Takeaways
>
> - **Reddit reveals GEO demand** — Discussions in r/AskMarketing, r/growthmarketing, and r/DigitalMarketing highlight the growing need for AI visibility tracking tools like Brandlight and RankShift.ai.
> - **Manual monitoring is unscalable** — Manually checking ChatGPT and Perplexity for brand mentions is impractical for competitive benchmarking and long-tail query discovery across different AI platforms like Gemini and Claude.
> - **AI lacks referral data** — Unlike Google, AI engines such as ChatGPT and Perplexity don't provide referrer information, making traditional attribution methods using UTM tags and conversion pixels ineffective.
> - **GEO is the new SEO** — A marketer's comparison of "6 Platforms for AI Visibility and GEO for 2026" on Reddit garnered significant engagement, suggesting GEO is emerging as a critical discipline.
> - **Tool landscape is fragmented** — The Reddit threads reveal confusion about the functionality, pricing, and effectiveness of existing AI citation tracking platforms, indicating a need for more mature solutions.

The responses reveal something fascinating about the current state of generative engine optimization (GEO): marketers know they need visibility monitoring, they understand AI search is reshaping discovery, but the tool landscape remains fragmented and confusing.

This isn't just Reddit noise. It's a real-time snapshot of a market gap—one that represents both an opportunity and a warning for brands betting on earned media infrastructure.

## The Pattern: Demand Without Clear Solutions

In a recent r/AskMarketing thread, marketers discussed tools like Brandlight, AnswerManiac, and RankShift.ai for tracking AI citations. Another thread in r/growthmarketing asked specifically about "tracking AI citations, what tools are people using?"

The responses were telling:

- Manual checks of ChatGPT and Perplexity

- Scattered mentions of monitoring platforms

- Questions about whether these tools actually work

- Confusion about pricing and features

- No consensus on category leaders

One marketer posted a "6 Platforms for AI Visibility and GEO for 2026" comparison, positioning GEO as the new SEO. The engagement was immediate—upvotes, comments asking for more details, DMs requesting recommendations.

This is what nascent demand looks like. The pain is real, the need is validated, but the solution set is still forming.

## Why the Measurement Gap Exists

The GEO measurement challenge mirrors early SEO analytics before Google Analytics standardized traffic attribution. Here's why it's still fragmented:

### 1. AI Search Engines Don't Provide Referral Data

Traditional search analytics work because Google passes referrer information when users click. But AI engines like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Gemini don't operate on a click model—they synthesize answers and cite sources inline.

When your brand appears in a ChatGPT response, you won't see it in Google Analytics. There's no UTM tag, no referral string, no conversion pixel. The citation exists, but your attribution stack is blind to it.

### 2. Manual Monitoring Doesn't Scale

Some marketers are checking AI engines manually—typing their brand name or target keywords into ChatGPT or Perplexity and noting whether they appear in responses.

This works for spot checks, but it's impossibly manual for:

- Multiple query variations

- Competitive benchmarking

- Trend analysis over time

- Different AI platforms (ChatGPT vs Perplexity vs Gemini vs Claude)

- Regional or language-specific monitoring

Manual checks also introduce bias—you're only testing queries you *think* matter, not discovering the long-tail queries where AI engines actually cite you.

### 3. The Tool Landscape Is Immature

Monitoring platforms are emerging (Brandlight, RankShift, AnswerManiac, etc.), but they're still early-stage:

- Inconsistent coverage across AI engines

- Limited historical data

- Unclear methodology for citation scoring

- Expensive pricing tiers for features that should be table-stakes

- No integration with existing marketing analytics stacks

Compare this to SEO in 2005—before Moz, Ahrefs, or SEMrush consolidated the market. Marketers were using toolbar PageRank checkers, manual SERP tracking spreadsheets, and fragmented link databases. The infrastructure hadn't matured yet.

We're in that same phase for GEO right now.

### 4. Brands Don't Know What Good Looks Like

Even if you *can* track AI visibility, what's the benchmark?

- Is a 10% citation rate in ChatGPT responses good?

- How much weight should you give Perplexity vs. Gemini?

- Does citation position matter (first source vs. third)?

- What's the conversion correlation between AI visibility and actual traffic?

These questions don't have industry-standard answers yet. Early adopters are building their own frameworks, but most brands are waiting for best practices to emerge.

## The Reddit Signal: Market Validation for GEO Infrastructure

When marketers crowdsource tool recommendations on Reddit, it's not because they lack budget or authority to buy software. It's because:

- **They don't trust vendor marketing** - GEO tool vendors are still proving credibility

- **They want peer validation** - "Does anyone actually use this and get value?"

- **They're comparing nascent solutions** - No clear category leader has emerged

- **They're testing before committing** - Budgets are tight, and experimental spend requires evidence

This is how SaaS markets form. Before HubSpot dominated inbound marketing or Salesforce owned CRM, professionals asked peers on forums: "What are you using? Does it work?" (See also: [Ai killing traditional pr metrics](https://blog.authoritytech.io/ai-killing-traditional-pr-metrics))

Reddit threads about GEO monitoring are a leading indicator—not a trailing one.

## What This Means for Brands Betting on Earned Media

If you're investing in earned media to drive AI visibility (press placements, thought leadership, expert citations), the measurement gap creates a strategic problem:

**You can't prove ROI without attribution data.**

Here's the reality:

- You publish a byline article in TechCrunch

- ChatGPT starts citing it in responses about your category

- Qualified prospects see your brand in AI-generated research

- Some visit your site, some don't (but they're influenced)

- Your analytics show nothing

Traditional attribution models—first-touch, last-touch, multi-touch—assume trackable referral paths. AI citations break that assumption. (See also: [Pr for startups ai search strategy](https://blog.authoritytech.io/pr-for-startups-ai-search-strategy-2026))

This doesn't mean earned media doesn't work in the AI era. In fact, [University of Toronto research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01213) shows AI engines cite earned media 5x more than brand websites. The *impact* is there.

But if your CMO asks "What's the ROI on our earned media program?"—and you can't connect AI citations to pipeline—you'll struggle to defend the budget.

## The Emerging Solution Stack

Smart brands aren't waiting for the market to consolidate. They're building their own GEO measurement frameworks using a combination of:

### 1. Snapshot Monitoring Tools

Platforms like RankShift.ai, Brandlight, and AnswerManiac provide point-in-time visibility tracking. You can see whether your brand appears in AI responses for specific queries.

**Use case:** Baseline benchmarking, competitive analysis, QBR reporting.

**Limitation:** No attribution to business outcomes.

### 2. GA4 Traffic Source Tagging

Some AI engines (Perplexity, SearchGPT) *do* pass referral data when users click through. If you're cited, you can track visits in Google Analytics.

**Use case:** Direct traffic attribution from AI engines that support referrals.

**Limitation:** Most AI citations don't result in immediate clicks. ChatGPT doesn't send referral traffic at all.

### 3. Brand Lift Studies

Measure awareness, consideration, and intent before and after earned media campaigns. Correlate AI visibility increases with brand metric improvements.

**Use case:** Executive-level storytelling, proving influence without direct attribution.

**Limitation:** Requires investment in brand research infrastructure.

### 4. First-Party Attribution via Intent Signals

Track when prospects mention AI research in sales conversations. Ask "How did you hear about us?" in demo forms and log responses that mention ChatGPT, Perplexity, or "AI research."

**Use case:** Qualitative validation of AI-driven discovery.

**Limitation:** Manual, qualitative, doesn't scale to full funnel.

### 5. Earned Media Attribution Models

Use UTM tagging on press placements, backlink monitoring, and publication analytics to track downstream traffic from earned placements—even if AI citations themselves don't pass referrer data. (See also: [Why traditional pr agencies collapsing](https://blog.authoritytech.io/why-traditional-pr-agencies-collapsing-2026))

**Use case:** Connect earned media to traffic, even if AI citation is the hidden middle step.

**Limitation:** Attribution is indirect (you track the article, not the AI engine citing it).

## The Future of GEO Measurement

The Reddit threads asking "how do you track AI visibility?" won't exist in two years. By then:

- **AI engines will provide citation analytics** - Google Search Console-style dashboards showing your brand's AI visibility, citation frequency, and click-through rates (where applicable)

- **Third-party tools will mature** - Ahrefs, SEMrush, Moz will integrate GEO monitoring into their core platforms

- **Standards will emerge** - Industry frameworks for GEO benchmarking, citation scoring, and AI-to-traffic attribution

- **Earned media platforms will build it in** - PR and content distribution platforms will track AI citations as a native metric

But right now? The market is wide open.

## What to Do Today

If you're investing in earned media for AI visibility, here's your pragmatic roadmap:

### 1. Set Up Basic Monitoring

Pick one GEO monitoring tool (RankShift, Brandlight, or AnswerManiac) and establish baseline visibility:

- Track 10-20 high-value keywords in your category

- Monitor your brand name + competitor brands

- Check ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Gemini monthly

**Goal:** Know where you stand today.

### 2. Tag Your Earned Media URLs

Use UTM parameters on every byline article, press mention, and thought leadership placement:

- utm_source=earned-media

- utm_medium=press or byline or podcast

- utm_campaign=[publication-name]

Even if AI citations don't pass referral data, you'll see which publications drive *direct* traffic—and that correlates with AI citability.

**Goal:** Build indirect attribution data.

### 3. Ask Prospects How They Found You

Add a "How did you hear about us?" field to demo forms, with options including:

- AI search (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini)

- Google search

- Press article

- Social media

- Referral

Track responses in your CRM and report on AI-sourced leads quarterly.

**Goal:** Qualitative validation of AI discovery.

### 4. Run AI Citation Audits After Earned Media Campaigns

After every major press placement or byline publish:

- Wait 2-4 weeks for AI indexing

- Test 20+ related queries in ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Gemini

- Document whether the new placement increases citation frequency

**Goal:** Prove earned media drives AI visibility.

### 5. Report AI Visibility as a Leading Indicator

In your quarterly marketing reports, include:

- AI citation frequency for top keywords

- Competitor citation comparison

- New publications that AI engines cite

- Trend direction (up, flat, down)

Position AI visibility as a *leading indicator* of brand awareness—not a lagging traffic metric.

**Goal:** Educate stakeholders on the new discovery model.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How do I track brand mentions in ChatGPT?

Traditional SEO tools don't capture ChatGPT citations because AI engines don't provide referral data; emerging GEO tools like Brandlight and AnswerManiac aim to address this gap by monitoring AI responses for brand mentions. Manually checking ChatGPT is possible, but it's unscalable for comprehensive monitoring.

### What are the best GEO tools for Perplexity AI?

While no single tool dominates, platforms like RankShift.ai are being explored for tracking citations in Perplexity AI and other generative engines. Reddit discussions reveal marketers are actively seeking and comparing solutions, but the landscape is still evolving.

### Why isn't my earned media showing up in Google Analytics from AI?

AI search engines like ChatGPT and Gemini don't use a traditional click-through model, so they don't pass referrer information to Google Analytics. This makes it impossible to track AI-driven traffic using standard UTM parameters or conversion pixels, creating a GEO measurement gap.

### Is GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) the same as SEO?

GEO is emerging as a distinct discipline focused on optimizing for visibility in AI-powered search engines, while SEO targets traditional search engines like Google. GEO addresses the unique challenges of AI's citation-based results, where referral data is absent.

### How can I measure the ROI of my PR efforts in AI search?

Measuring PR ROI in AI search requires tracking brand mentions and citations within generative engine responses, which is different from traditional web traffic analysis; solutions involve using specialized GEO tools or developing custom monitoring systems to capture AI citations from platforms like Perplexity and Claude.

## The Bottom Line

When marketers turn to Reddit to ask "how do you track AI visibility?"—it's not a sign of ignorance. It's a signal that the market infrastructure hasn't caught up to strategic need.

Brands investing in earned media *know* AI visibility matters. They *see* competitors appearing in ChatGPT and Perplexity responses. They *understand* that citations drive awareness and consideration.

But the measurement gap forces them to operate on faith—or cobble together manual tracking—while waiting for the tool ecosystem to mature.

The opportunity for brands is this: **You don't need perfect attribution to win at GEO. You need to move faster than your category while competitors wait for clarity.**

The brands that establish citation dominance *now*—through strategic earned media, source authority, and expert positioning—will own the AI visibility advantage when measurement standards finally arrive.

By then, Reddit will have moved on to the next unsolved problem. And you'll already be cited.

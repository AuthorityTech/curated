Share of Voice (SOV) measures your brand's visibility in search compared to competitors, but in 2026, SOV has evolved beyond traditional rankings. According to [Airops' 2026 State of AI Search report](https://www.airops.com/report/the-2026-state-of-ai-search), during early brand discovery, 85% of brand mentions occur via external third-party domains, and brands are 6.5× more likely to be cited through third-party sources than their own websites. This means your SOV in AI search depends on earned media placements, not just your website rankings.

This shift changes everything. When buyers research solutions in ChatGPT or Perplexity, they're seeing answers built from earned media citations, not brand-owned content. Your share of voice in AI search isn't determined by how well you rank on Google, but by how often authoritative publications mention your brand.

## What Share of Voice Means in the AI Search Era

Traditional share of voice measures how much of the total search visibility you capture compared to competitors. It's calculated as your impressions or clicks divided by the total impressions or clicks for all competitors targeting the same keywords, multiplied by 100 to get a percentage.

But AI search has fundamentally changed this equation. [Yext's analysis of 6.8 million AI citations](https://www.yext.com/about/news-media/ai-citations-release) reveals that while brands can influence 86% of citations through owned and managed sources, earned media remains the dominant driver of AI search visibility, with third-party publications being cited far more frequently than brand websites for informational queries.

This means your share of voice in AI search includes:

- **AI citation frequency:** How often your brand is cited in AI-generated answers

- **AI visibility score:** Aggregate measure of your presence across ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, and Google AI Overviews

- **Zero-click penetration:** Share of queries where users get answers without clicking through

- **Traditional metrics:** Impressions, clicks, and position in traditional search results

The brands winning share of voice in 2026 aren't just ranking well on Google, they're being cited directly in AI answers, appearing in zero-click results, and dominating the conversations that happen before users even visit a website.

## Why Earned Media Drives Share of Voice in AI Search

Earned media drives share of voice in AI search because AI engines prioritize third-party, authoritative sources over brand-owned content. When you secure coverage in tier-1 publications, those citations become the building blocks of AI answers.

[Airops' research](https://www.airops.com/report/the-2026-state-of-ai-search) reveals that when users are in early brand discovery phases—comparing options or exploring categories—85% of brand mentions happen through external third-party domains like review sites, comparison pages, and listicles. Brands are 6.5× more likely to be cited through these third-party sources than through their own websites. This means when someone asks ChatGPT or Perplexity about your industry, the answers are built primarily from earned media coverage and third-party mentions.

Position matters too: approximately 80% of those third-party mentions appear in the top three placements on those pages, meaning brands need to secure prominent positions in comparison content and roundups to maximize their share of voice in AI search results.

Here's why this matters for share of voice:

- **Citations equal visibility:** Every earned media citation that appears in an AI answer increases your share of voice, even if users don't click through

- **Authority signals:** AI engines trust publications like Forbes, TechCrunch, and industry journals more than brand websites

- **Zero-click dominance:** When AI answers surface your brand in zero-click results, you're capturing share of voice without traditional traffic

- **Competitive advantage:** Brands with strong earned media programs dominate AI search visibility, leaving competitors invisible

AI engines prefer structured, objective content with statistics, bullet points, and action verbs—all hallmarks of quality earned media coverage. When earned media placements include clear data points and structured information, they're more likely to be cited in AI-generated answers, directly improving your share of voice.

## Modern Metrics for Share of Voice in AI Search

Measuring share of voice in 2026 requires new metrics beyond traditional impressions and clicks. Here are the modern metrics that matter:

### AI Citation Frequency

AI citation frequency measures how often your brand is cited in AI-generated answers across ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, and Google AI Overviews. This metric shows your actual visibility in the AI search landscape.

To measure AI citation frequency:

- Query your brand name and key topics in each AI engine

- Track how often your brand appears in answers

- Note which publications are cited alongside your brand

- Monitor citation position (first citation vs. later citations)

High AI citation frequency means your earned media strategy is working. Low frequency means you're invisible in AI search, regardless of your Google rankings.

### AI Visibility Score

AI visibility score is an aggregate measure of your presence across all AI search platforms. It combines citation frequency, citation position, and platform diversity into a single metric.

Calculate AI visibility score by:

- Assigning points for citations (first citation = 10 points, second = 7 points, third = 5 points, etc.)

- Weighting by platform importance (ChatGPT = 1.0, Perplexity = 0.8, Gemini = 0.7, Google AI Overviews = 1.2)

- Summing across all platforms and queries

- Comparing to competitors' scores

Your AI visibility score shows your competitive position in AI search, independent of traditional [SEO](https://blog.authoritytech.io/ai-search-traffic-worth-10x-google-traffic) metrics.

### Zero-Click Penetration

Zero-click penetration measures the share of queries where users get answers without clicking through to any website. In AI search, this includes answers in ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, and Google AI Overviews.

High zero-click penetration means you're capturing share of voice even when users don't visit your site. This is increasingly important as [Gartner predicts](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2024-02-19-gartner-predicts-search-engine-volume-will-drop-25-percent-by-2026-due-to-ai-chatbots-and-other-virtual-agents) traditional search engine volume will drop 25% by 2026 as AI chatbots and virtual agents substitute many queries.

### Traditional Metrics (Still Important)

Traditional share of voice metrics still matter:

- **Impressions:** How often your site appears in search results

- **Clicks:** How often users click through to your site

- **Position:** Average ranking position for target keywords

- **CTR:** Click-through rate (clicks divided by impressions)

But these metrics only tell part of the story. Your complete share of voice picture includes both traditional search visibility and AI search visibility.

## How to Measure Share of Voice with Earned Media Focus

Measuring share of voice with an earned media focus requires tracking both traditional metrics and modern AI search metrics. Here's a step-by-step framework:

### Step 1: Define Your Keyword Set

Select 20-50 keywords that represent your market space. Include:

- High-volume, high-intent keywords (e.g., "best [product category]")

- Mid-volume, specific keywords (e.g., "[product] for [use case]")

- Long-tail, niche keywords (e.g., "how to [specific task] with [product]")

Exclude branded keywords (your brand name, competitor brand names) to get a true picture of competitive visibility.

### Step 2: Track Traditional Search Metrics

Use tools like Google Search Console, SEMrush, or Ahrefs to track:

- Your impressions and clicks for each keyword

- Your average position for each keyword

- Competitors' impressions, clicks, and positions

Calculate traditional SOV: (Your clicks ÷ Total clicks for all competitors) × 100

### Step 3: Track AI Search Metrics

For each keyword, query ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, and Google AI Overviews:

- Count how often your brand is cited

- Note which publications are cited alongside your brand

- Track citation position (first, second, third, etc.)

- Record which earned media placements drive citations

Calculate AI SOV: (Your AI citations ÷ Total AI citations for all competitors) × 100

### Step 4: Combine Metrics for Complete Picture

Your total share of voice combines traditional and AI search metrics:

**Total SOV = (Traditional SOV × 0.6) + (AI SOV × 0.4)**

This weighting reflects that traditional search still drives most traffic, but AI search is growing rapidly. Adjust weights based on your industry and buyer behavior.

### Step 5: Track Over Time

Measure share of voice monthly to track trends:

- Is your traditional SOV growing or declining?

- Is your AI SOV improving with earned media placements?

- Are competitors gaining ground in AI search?

- Which earned media placements drive the most AI citations?

Regular tracking helps you identify what's working and what needs adjustment.

## Actionable Strategies to Improve Share of Voice Through Earned Media

Improving share of voice through earned media requires a strategic approach focused on securing placements that AI engines cite. Here are actionable strategies:

### Strategy 1: Target Tier-1 Publications That AI Engines Trust

AI engines cite authoritative publications more frequently. Focus your earned media efforts on:

- Industry-leading publications (Forbes, TechCrunch, Harvard Business Review)

- High-authority news sites (Reuters, The Guardian, The Verge)

- Respected industry journals and trade publications

- Academic and research institutions

Platforms like AuthorityTech help brands secure guaranteed placements in tier-1 publications, directly improving AI citation frequency and share of voice. These placements are performance-based, meaning you only pay when coverage is secured.

### Strategy 2: Structure Content for AI Citation

AI engines prefer content with:

- Clear statistics and data points (with sources)

- Bullet points and structured lists

- Objective, factual language

- Recent publication dates (content less than a year old)

When pitching earned media, provide journalists with data-rich content that AI engines can easily extract and cite.

### Strategy 3: Focus on Comparison and "Best Of" Content

AI engines frequently cite comparison content and "best of" lists. Secure placements in:

- "Best [product category]" roundups

- Comparison articles ("X vs Y")

- Industry rankings and awards

- Expert opinion pieces

These placements are highly citable because they provide clear, structured information that AI engines can extract.

### Strategy 4: Monitor and Respond to AI Citations

Track how your earned media placements are cited in AI answers:

- Query your brand name in ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Gemini weekly

- Note which publications are cited

- Identify which placements drive the most citations

- Double down on what's working

Use this data to refine your earned media strategy and focus on placements that improve AI visibility.

### Strategy 5: Create Content Hubs Around Key Topics

Build clusters of earned media coverage around your core topics:

- Secure multiple placements on the same topic

- Create a network of citations that reinforce your authority

- Ensure consistent messaging across placements

When AI engines see multiple authoritative sources mentioning your brand on the same topic, they're more likely to cite you.

### Strategy 6: Leverage Press Releases Strategically

Well-structured press releases can improve AI citation potential. Structure press releases with:

- Clear statistics and data points

- Bullet points for key information

- Objective, factual language

- Action verbs and specific details

Well-structured press releases are more likely to be cited by AI engines, improving your share of voice.

### Strategy 7: Measure and Optimize Continuously

Share of voice isn't a one-time measurement. Track metrics monthly and optimize:

- Which earned media placements drive the most AI citations?

- Which topics generate the most visibility?

- Where are competitors gaining ground?

- What content formats perform best?

Use this data to refine your earned media strategy and improve share of voice over time.

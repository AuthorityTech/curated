## The Growth Rate Divergence: Not All Platforms Are Equal

From January to December 2025, [major LLM platforms](https://previsible.io/seo-strategy/ai-seo-study-2025/) grew at dramatically different rates. ChatGPT grew 3x. Copilot? 25x. Claude hit 13x growth, while Perplexity and Gemini stayed effectively flat at 1x.
